{"11-20-2022": ["Okay, so it's time to own up to some fish facts! As my opinions and discussions have become more developed, I'd like to clarify a few things about Traditional Medicine. I don't think my original fact was exactly fair. I used some language that could be pretty unclear, and that hinted at some bad ideas and concepts. \nSo, just to clarify, some traditional medicine does have ways of working that are tested and known to our evidence-based medical system. But these things are in the minority. This does not mean that traditional medicine is quackery. Instead, what this means is that it helps people in a way that the evidence-based medicine I'm personally familiar with either does not take into consideration, or that it does not understand yet. In many ways, the evidence-based approach has a lot of growing to do, especially in the realm of the use of placebos. \nFrequently you find stories of traditional medicine being used as a last resort for someone who is dying and is seeking final comforts in knowing every possible was tried. Often these medicines, while the mechanism is unknown and likely a placebo, have observable, physical effects. These medicines help people and it's not for me to say that they are wrong. \nAs someone who has made their life in North America, I should note that this is not my problem to solve.  Traditional medicine is just that, a tradition of a culture I am not part of. While I can look at its effects on the animals I love, I cannot comment on the traditions or on the effectiveness of the medicine. In fact, I think that teaching others about this could be somewhat dangerous. Studies done now about education about traditional medicine in conservation organizations have shown that frequently people leave with racist attitudes. Content warning, Racism: ||People have said things like \"Those Asians always killing things to get boners\" or \"Why don't the Chinese know that it doesn't work?\"|| Absolute horrible stereotypes. I will leave my fact up, as discord has a different reach than those organizations had, but I've only chosen to do that after much thought. If you are someone from not those cultures who is reading the fish facts, I do ask that you realize that it is not your job to comment on those things. However, the taking of animals for those purposes is something those places and people need to resolve or those animals will go extinct. \nBut don't worry my fellow North Americans! We have SO many conservation problems we are doing as cultural norms that we should do to protect animals. The one off the top of my head is the American/European tradition of having a \"lawn\". A modern lawn is usually a relatively flat area covered by a single species of short-growing grass. Even then, the grass must be cut short so it grows no more than 5 cm in height. A whole industry has arisen around this process. Huge amounts of land have been dedicated to growing this grass to put into lawns. Hours of time either by the lawn owner or by people who are paid by the owner are spent on the maintaining of this space. And the two worst things for fish, gas power tools and fertilizers. Often the cutting tools for lawns are powered by small gas engines that are extremely inefficient. Meaning that cutting a lawn can produce tons of carbon dioxide for only the purposes of... appearance, I guess? I've talked about fertilizers before, but lawns seem to absorb less than half of the chemical fertilizers given to them. Meaning that all that extra nutrient goes straight down the drain and into waterways where it can harm fish.", "Okay that whole fact was a bit of a downer, so here's one that's a bit more peppy: the demon fish of Florida. So a few people in Florida are sending in photos of a super dried out dead fish that looks really scary. As the fish has dried, the teeth have become visible and the skin has dried to a dark color. As soon as the photo started to make the rounds, all sorts of names came up, snakehead, piranha, and of course, the supernatural \"demon fish.\" \nAnyway, it's a bowfin. Native to Florida.

We then sunk deep into what makes a fish a fish. A series of random exceptions to the rules kept going for a few facts after that. \nWe then did some random species facts! From slime to seahorses. As we went through we talked about some of the things like scales, fins, and fossils! \nSome deep-sea adaptations too, like bioluminescence, cold seeps, and hydrothermal vents! Hagfish and hearts. We've discussed the human uses of fish, like fish oils and of course eating fish. There were like 50 facts about cod alone. Goldfish and carp dominated the facts for a while too! Lots of pop culture fish, from the holy mackerel to goldfish the snack food (BTDUBS the first ingredient in goldfish is smiles had to get that correction in). \nWe talked about fish in science, and even in space. The fish that help make our medicine and test for pollution. We talked about fish that are gone and fish that are near gone. We've talked about fish who invade and push out other fish. We've talked about how we can help fish and how we hurt them.\nNot to wax poetic for too long, but  I think it shows some of the coolest parts about studying animals. We as humans are inexorably linked to fish, just as we are to most everything alive on the planet.

That said, I think I'm going to have to slow down on the fish facts for now. I think rather than trying to push one out every day, I'm going to switch to only doing a fact every so often. Maybe weekly, maybe monthly, really just whenever it seems to be important or when I get a request. It's not that there aren't more fish facts, I could likely keep going until I die.

It was widely criticized. \nThe whole plot takes place underwater with a variety of anthropomorphized fish. They are hideous in appearance, with human faces and fish bodies. We follow Oscar, a Bluestreak Wrasse who wishes to be rich and famous, but instead works at a \"whale wash.\" Oscar is voiced by Will Smith. He gets in trouble with some sort of shark gang, and eventually ends up accidently dropping an anchor on the neck of a shark, killing the shark. He then becomes popular as people think he murdered the shark on purpose. Eventually his love interest gets kidnapped and a nice shark and Oscar stage a rescue. He loses his popularity but the nice shark gets accepted by his family. Oscar goes back to the whale wash and works there, presumably until his death. \nOn release, the show received 36% positive reviews. It was criticized as the shark crime family is depicted with Italian stereotypes.  It is pretty bad. There are also some really bad representations of black people.  The nice shark subplot was often interpreted as a story about accepting homosexuality in families, and was therefore protested by many groups including the American Family Association.

In dealing with seafood sellers, I've found that a few of them had specific delivery times on Saturdays and Mondays most frequently. So in my own experience it's not really great advice. \nNot to mention that even when the saying originated you had a pretty good chance of getting not fresh seafood whenever you went.

I wanna talk about the privately held Landry's, Inc. According to their website, they own and operate more than 600 restaurants, hotels, casinos and \"entertainment destinations\". So cool. As far as seafood places it is the second largest behind only Red Lobster. They are currently owned by Tilman Fertitta, a multibillionaire. \nIf you live in the US, chances are you live near a location they own. As far as food places go, they own: Del Frisco's, Mastro's Restaurants, Morton's The Steakhouse, The Palm, Strip House, Vic & Anthony's Steakhouse, Bubba Gump Shrimp Company, Claim Jumper, Houlihan's, Joe's Crab Shack (I don't know if they still own this one I don't think so?), McCormick & Schmick's, Rainforest Cafe, Saltgrass Steak House, Atlantic Grill, Grand Concourse, Jake's Famous Crawfish, Babbin's Seafood House, The Boathouse, Blue Fin Seafood, . Of course, they also own Landry's.

Many of their places have large fish displays, which you probably know if you've ever been into a Rainforest Cafe. They have their hands deep in the fish industry. Landry's owns the \"Aquarium Restaurant\" chain, which includes some pretty big players in the Aquarium industry, including the Downtown Aquariums in Denver, Colorado and Houston, Texas. Also, they have locations in Kemah, Texas and Nashville Tennessee. \nSo those that know me or who have been reading fish facts for a while know that I am at least slightly in favor of Aquariums. My personal opinion is that they do a great job of connecting people to animals that otherwise would feel distant and alien. That connection allows them to move towards conservation of those animals and the waters they live in. That gets complicated though when you look at a leviathan like Landry's Inc. \nThese aquariums are for-profit. The end goal is usually to make money.

The windows are not a concern, they were made of acrylic plastic, easily able to withstand a baseball hit even by a pro. Sound however is an issue, as it likely can at least cause stress in fish. The fish and tanks were removed in 2021, without a reason given. My guess is that it wasn't for the health of the fish, fish and habitats are extremely expensive to maintain, and likely required staff specifically for the care.

Methuselah arrived from Australia, which makes sense, as she is an Australian Lungfish (I've talked about these guys in past facts, lungfish are pretty cool).

Each part serves a different role (we think)! \nThe olfactory lobe probably receives and processes signals from the olfactory nerves, so mostly taste/smell. Diencephalon does some hormone stuff and regulates homeostasis. The telencephalon is still a bit of a mystery, and may have something to do with social behavior as its larger and more pronounced in fish that are social. The Optic nerve deals with all things eye. Cerebellum is weird and complicated, likely doing many different things all at once.

The fish are often more willing to take bait, and you can get your fishing equipment to places that'd be hard to get to otherwise.  \nThis has turned into a whole thing. Native Americans and First Peoples would use spears and clubs to catch fish after breaking the ice with axes. Nowadays, ice fishing is mostly done by hook and line. An auger, usually gas-powered drills a hole in the ice and a fisherman drops some sort of bait down into the water. Sometimes an ice saw is used to make a bigger hole. Usually this is some sort of Jig, which is moved around in the water too look like something living, or a Tip-Up, which suspends bait in the water without even needing a human there. \nMany places have huts or shelters that will be placed around the ice holes, these are usually simple and used to keep warm, but some are extremely complex and include bedrooms and even bathrooms. Some shelters are only tents. As it is usually very cold, it's important to keep your fishing hole from freezing over. There's a tool usually called a skimmer that is used to break up and remove ice on the hole before it gets too thick, but below about -20 F (-29 C) it becomes almost impossible.\nIce fishing does have quite a few dangers! Obviously falling through the ice is a big issue. It's recommended never to go out onto ice thinner than 4 inches, (10 cm). It's recommended to be 7\u201312 in thick (18\u201330 cm) for light cars, and 14\u201316 inches (36\u201341 cm) for full-sized trucks.

The name does not come from the ability to swim in the booze, they are actually quite sensitive to pollution. They are only native to a small area in Central Mexico, they were thought to live in rivers, and even then, only the Ameca River basin. They are named after the Tequila \n volcano that sits nearby. Unfortunately, the past tense of that last bit gives away the bad news. The fish was essentially extinct in the wild. They were no longer found in the rivers they used to live in, and were thought to be completely gone until a small pool was found with about 50 individuals in it. They were likely killed off by introduced species, pollution, and habitat destruction. \nBefore they vanished, they were taken by aquarists, hobbyists and professional researchers alike. The population was maintained, and has recently been re-introduced to the Teuchitl\u00e1n River in Jalisco, and seems to be doing well, and growing! The population was introduced in late 2020 though, so the story can change so fast. A recent study on the newly released fish showed that almost all of them shared more than half of their genetics, meaning that inbreeding and the problems associated with that will likely be a problem soon, if not now. \nBUT, if this works, then it could be a blueprint for other fish species that are gone in the wild.

This one may be a bit short, but I do want to bring it up as it's a problem that I've seen. So in many freshwater lakes in the far North and far South, as well as some rivers, the winter months bring a thick layer of ice. This covers the surface of the lake. \nThat layer of ice does not go all the way down. The deeper you go, the less likely the water is to freeze. The ice insulates the water below it, and the pressure prevents it from freezing easily. That makes sure the fish below the ice don't freeze. If a body of water is small enough to freeze all the way through it won't support fish life. \nThe ecosystem does not rely on the surface for survival, while there is less food after the lake is sealed off with ice, there is still input of energy from the sun, and the fish often will pre-prepare all summer and spring, gaining weight to survive for winter. They still eat all winter, catching anything they can. \nAnother thing I've heard is that fish will die because there is no oxygen exchange from the air.

So this fact is gonna be a bit boring, but I've said too much not to mention some of these vocabulary words.\nSo the group of cartilaginous fishes is called Chondrichthyes. It includes all sharks, rays, and if you remember from many facts ago, the chimaeras. Oftentimes it is contrasted with the Osteichthyes, the boney fish. \nChondrichthyes is a class, and it is split into two subclasses, Elasmobranchii and Holocephali. Elasmobranchii is sharks and rays, Holocephali is the chimaeras. You may have seen or heard me refer to a shark or a ray as an Elasmobranch, that's why. It's not really that descriptive of a term, but it's a common one. \nOften Elasmobranchii  is divided into 3ish superorders. Galean\nsharks (superorder Galeomorphii) includes Orectolobiformes, Lamniformes, Heterodontiformes, and Carcharhiniformes.  The rest of the sharks are called Squalomorph sharks (superorder Squalomorphii). The rays, for some reason, are usually just called rays (sometimes superorder Batoidea). \nGeebus that's a lot of garbage, and it doesn't even go into the cladistics of extinct Chondrichthyes!

There are 69 (nice) species in four families. Sometimes they get the name crampfish or numbfish, the word torpere means \"to paralyze\" in Latin, which hints at the purpose and strength of their electrogenic capabilities. \nThey eat fish and inverts like crabs, lying in wait and then using their electricity to shock their prey. \nElectric rays have huge electric organs on either side of their body, taking up a good chunk of the round disk that makes up their body. The organs essentially build up a charge like a battery and then discharge the electricity all at once when needed. The organ is made up of many gelatinous columns that act as batteries individually. The largest rays can produce voltages around 220 volts, at around 30 amps. That's a lower voltage but higher amperage than an electric eel, most people think that's due to different conductivities between the saltwater the rays live in and the freshwater the eels live in. The method of generation is slightly different too, check out the electric eel fact! The eels generally have their generation set up in series, good to overwhelm the strong resistance of freshwater. In salt water, the rays have the organs set up in parallel, as the strongest resistance is the organ itself. But the saltwater is so conductive they need really strong current to produce any results. \nIn ancient times the shock from the fish was used for various things. In humans it usually causes cramps, or numbness, not anything too dangerous. There is some evidence the Ancient Greeks used them to help numb pain during childbirth or surgeries. In Compositiones Medicae written in Rome around 46 AD, they are prescribed for headaches and gout (they likely don't help with either). \nBefore electricity was discovered, they were thought to be magical. They were taken as evidence that nature had abilities far beyond what humans would ever understand. However, that all changed with Henry Cavendish, a famous scientist who did a LOT of stuff.

We already talked about Rhinopristiformes, those are the sawfish! \nMyliobatiformes are essentially your default rays. They usually have rounded bodies, and the tail that you probably picture when you think of a stingray. Most species are benthic, meaning that they live on the bottom. These rays are the ones most commonly responsible for stings on humans, as they live coastally and on the bottom, making them easy to step on. Short-tail stingrays and Southern stingrays are common examples of these species.

This is a practice where after catching a fish on a hook, if fishing recreationally it is somewhat common to release the fish back into the water alive. If one likes to fish for pleasure or recreation, it's probably the best way to fish for the animals and their habitat. \nHowever, one should keep in mind that catch and release fishing is not entirely safe for the fish. Oftentimes there are many problems that could cause the fish to die during or after being fished. Some are impossible to avoid, others can be prevented. Let's talk factors that kill fish.\nSometimes you're just working with a delicate or already stressed fish. If the environment is having problems, or the fish is sick, the fish will already be close to death before you catch it and the stress and exhaustion from being caught will kill it. Not much you can do about that, but try not to go fishing during times where fish will be under a lot of stress. Think about the weather, avoid fishing during times when the water is especially hot or cold. \nWhere the fish was hooked is also important. A properly caught fish should have the hook pierce them though their lips, thin tissue that will not cause too much of a a problem and will heal quickly. However, sometimes fish swallow hooks and they pierce them though their throat or stomachs. The hook can also pierce the gills. That will likely kill the fish. Fishing properly can reduce the chance of this happening, but if it happens the best thing to do is to try and remove the hook using pliers or a disgorger (a special tool for this purpose). \nIf the fish is caught in deeper water, it will have some serious issues due to the swim bladder. You can pierce it to help, but it's iffy on if that solves the problem. See the swim bladder fact for more! \nIf you keep the fish out of water too long, play with the fish, or over exhaust the fish too much, the fish will likely die. Handle the fish as little as possible as every finger touch will wear off some of the fish\u2019s slime coat. Only ever handle fish with wet hands. Keep the fish wet, and be gentle but firm with your touch when you do have to handle them, dropping the fish is likely worse than gripping it.", "Here's what a disgorger looks like!", "/public/fishfacts/932037489231822888_ringers-floating-disgorgers-2643-1600.png", "The careful removal of a hook from a fish...

Again, A sawshark is a shark, a Sawfish is a ray (or its own thing entirely depending on who you ask). \nThe easiest difference is the gills! Sawsharks have their gills on the side of their body, like you'd expect for a shark. Sawfish have their gills on the underside of their body, like you'd expect for a ray. \nSawsharks have two sizes of teeth, longer teeth that are alternate with shorter teeth between. Sawfish have only one size. \nSawsharks are small and live in deep offshore waters, while saw fish get huge and live in mostly coastal waters. Sawsharks are poorly understood but likely doing okay.

They have disappeared from much of their range though, and are likely gone off the coast of Africa where they were once more plentiful. \nThey feed on fish and large inverts like crabs. The big saw is used for fish capture and manipulation, in similar ways to our saw sharks like we saw earlier! \nThey are Critically endangered. They are targeted by shark finnners (ironic because they are not a shark), easily entangled in nets and trash, and super slow to reproduce. \n The population's off of the Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi coasts has essentially vanished, although it is showing slow signs of recovery.

Often, as you find with most of the cichlids that specialize in this, they will mimic the patterns of their prey fish, allowing them to get close to their prey and then pluck a few scales. Some fish have special enzymes specifically to help them digest scales.\nMost fish get scales by basically plucking a few off the side, either by ramming into them or by sliding up to them and sneakily stealing some. \nLepidophagy is an odd niche. While scales are pretty good for fish nutritionally, they offer some pretty dangerous tradeoffs. You need to be sneaky or fast enough to get some scales.

It makes itself a really important and interesting river both geopolitically and as we know biologically. \nThe Giant Catfish isn't found anywhere but there.

As juveniles they probably eat plankton.\nThey use to be extremely important to the people who lived along the rivers. There are stories of them being plentiful along the river, feeding many people. The people who used to fish them have noticed declines too, last reporting 5 caught in 2000 from what used to be hundreds. Some people in Thailand have an almost religious reverence for the fish, and it appears in quite a bit of art. \nAs we know, exploitation and damming have made them critically endangered.

Dams have had a pretty significant uptick recently, with huge projects going up in South America, Africa, and especially Asia. In North America and Europe, the dams that were built are already established and have already done their thing.\nDams are important to humans, as they provide lots of electricity for essentially no cost to humans. (This is not true; dams displace tons of people but we aren't here for people we're here for fish) There are tons of costs to the animals that are in the water. \nFreshwater habitats, especially moving freshwater habitats (Rivers, creeks, streams) are very delicate. They require constant flow or the whole ecosystem essentially becomes a lake. This is something that dams cause, but dams also literally block movement. Large river animals rely on being able to move up and down the river to survive. Dams literally stop this. This causes what is known as habitat fragmentation, where you've turned one habitat that was large enough into two habitats that are not. Unfortunately, that effect is well documented in fish. \nSalmon are probably the biggest and most obvious example. Dams in the Pacific Northwest of the United States and Canada have cause collapses in the population of salmon, because they no longer can access their egg laying grounds. We're now seeing the same thing happen to fish in the places that are building dams now.\nThe Mekong River Catfish is a HUGE animal. We're talking 293 kg (646 lb) big. These guys rely on the river for feeding and breeding, so the large increase in dams is expected to reduce the population by about 40%. Trick with that is other activities including fishing and habitat destruction has reduced them already by 80%.

The embryo itself, which has lots of parts and stages we are not going to talk about. Space to develop into, often called perivitelline space. Then, surrounding them they have a shell, called the chorion.\nThe yolk is the bit that is important for development. This is a packed nutrient sack for the fish to grow on. Usually it's full of basically everything the fish needs, including sometimes an oil globule, a packet of oil to help provide energy. The embryo is protected from the outside world by the chorion, and grows into the perivitelline space until it can't anymore, and then hatches. Fish usually hatch with their yolk still attached.\nThe cool thing about fish eggs is you can see basically the exact same thing in other vertebrates, animals with a backbone. Amphibians, like frogs and newts and whathaveyou have eggs that are identical. Even birds, with their entirely land-based reproductive strategy basically have a fish egg encased in a goopy water like case. The goop inside a chicken egg that turns white when you cook it is lacking in fish eggs. It's basically a protein soup surrounding the actual egg that mimics water.

He famously was a friend of George Brown Goode, and they worked together as a duo on many things, often they are called \"The most successful duo in ichthyology\". I dunno, they probs did quite a bit, but they are no wonder twins. They wrote about 36 papers together, some are really cool. I think he more was the beneficiary of exploring waters that were poorly understood, so managed to learn a lot and name many species. His most famous works are about the fishes of Alaska and Washington. \nTarleton Hoffman Bean held many positions of honor, working at some of the big museums of his time, including Fish Commission laboratory in Connecticut US, and the National Museum. He was the director of the New York Aquarium for a short time, but was likely fired (asked to resign) for not getting along with some of his higher ups. After working on some worlds fairs, he became New York\u2019s state fish culturist, where he worked until he died in a car crash. (A fish culturist does not maintain fish arts and music; they are in charge of hatching fish.)\nHe's got some major weird quotes in some of his papers, my favorite being \"The territory of Alaska has 75 species of food-fishes, seven- eighths of which are strictly adapted to the use of man, the balance being more suitable for bait.\" Huh? 75 species of fish in a state roughly the size of Western Europe? You're telling me that you can only find 75 fish there? Whatever. Also, \"strictly adapted?\" what does this mean? Milton Love, among my favorite authors goes off about this quote in his book. Here's his quote:\n> \"What does \"strictly adapted\" to the use of man mean? Does it mean that these species are only adapted for man to use? What happens if a bear eats one? Will he go to Hell? What happens, if, say, a yellow eye rockfish doesn't want to be eaten by anyone? What if he just wants to hang out in his crevice eat the occasional sand lance, quietly engage in internal fertilization, and die at the age of 129 years? Will it go to Hell? And what about this \"strictly\" thing? Was Dr. Bean, out there in an igloo, into some sort of ichthyological bondage? Will he go to Hell? And is ichthyological bondage a good name for a scientific journal?\"\nHe ends his discussion on that there.

A weird title nowadays, as from a science point of view, there is no such thing as a fish. However, it is still used and was used frequently in the past.

If you've ever been in a biology course, it's likely that he came up at some point. He did a lot for classifying fish, sorting fish into different groups. He helped identify and categorize tons of different species (although many of these were later redone as they turned out to be wrong). His legacy unfortunately is overshadowed by his father, Louis Agassiz. Louis was a strong fighter of Darwin's theory of evolution, and a vocal proponent of Scientific Racism. He also contributed to fish quite a bit, but same story really with him, more just naming species. However, he also produced some of the most powerful evidence for evolution without knowing it, as he studied geology and distribution of fossils.

In the saltwater of the Atlantic coast there are two major types of saltwater catfish, the Hardhead catfish and the Gafftopsail Catfish. Both of these have various regional names, including tourist trout, seacat, and Gafftop. Found from basically Panama to Cape Cod, they are very common for people to find while fishing coastal waters. But, I'm not really hear to talk about them, I'm here to talk about their bones. \nSo, they have a pretty normal skeleton for their group, including a sturdy spine, venomous spines in their fins, and a hard scull to protect their heads. When the catfish dies, the spines and the spine both degrade quickly, and the many small bones in the scull fall away, leaving really only the hard cap to the scull. As this fish is very common on the coast, these hard bits of bone wash up on beaches all the time. \nWell, beachcombers found these and took it as a sign of God, as you do. If you flip the scull over so the part of the head that would normally be inside of the head is facing towards you, it looks slightly like a crucifix, a symbol in Christianity depicting Jesus's crucifixion on a cross. I guess I can see it if I squint maybe, but this seems to me to be a pretty good case of pareidolia, the human ability to perceive meaningful images in essentially random or meaningless images. \nNevertheless, humans have proceeded with much excitement around this. A fun poem was written by Conrad S. Lantz about it: \n> Of all the fish in the sea\n> our Lord chose the lowly sailcat\n> to remind us of His misery.\n> His body on the cross is outlined,\n> the hilt of the sword\n> which was plunged into His side\n> is clearly defined.\n> \n> Look at the back of the fishes bone\n> where the Roman shield is shown.\n> When you shake the cross\n> you will hear the dices being tossed\n> for our Lord\u2019s blood stained dress,\n> those who hear them\n> \u2014will be blessed.\nA fun poem, excluding that, in the versions I find, he uses in the second stanza \"fishes\" when he means \"fish's\".  Many others quote the bible Psalm 8 about it, here's verses 3 and 4 (KJV):\n> When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;\n> What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?\nJust as a reminder, this is just a fish fact, I'm not trying to take a stance on the existence of any god(s) or in any god's provision of signs.

This makes sense, we are essentially fish that are desperately trying to stay wet in a very dry world. So we drink water by putting it into the internal systems we have to absorb and withhold water. Fish live in water, so there's no need to pump it into the internal systems. \nMost fish absorb water from their surroundings, seeing as they live in water. Their gills can pump water into and out of their bloodstream, allowing them to stay hydrated. So, not really drinking per se, but they are intaking water. \nA weird side effect of this is that fish live in really two different common water scenarios, salt water and fresh water (Many in-betweens and exceptions but I'm going to ignore it). Check out the osmosis fact for more, but freshwater fish are going to be trying to slow water from coming into their body, while saltwater fish are trying to pump water in. Water always moves from less salty to saltier, so the insides of a fish in freshwater are saltier than the water they live in, and a fish in saltwater is less salty than the water they live in.

Slice your leeks in half lengthwise and lay them on the bottom of a 12 x 18 jelly roll pan or half-sheet pan of a similar size.\nCut away the peel, pith (the white stuff under the peel), and outer membranes from two of your oranges, then slice them into 1/4-inch round slices.\nRinse salmon under cold water, clean out the cavity, and pat it dry with a paper towel. Cut 3 shallow slits through salmon\u2019s skin, about 3 inches apart, on each side of fish. Season salmon cavity with salt and pepper.\nStuff the cavity with your fresh cilantro, sliced oranges, and sliced onion. Lay a piece of cheesecloth over the leeks in your pan, then lay the salmon on the cheesecloth. \nJuice the remaining two oranges into a small saucepan and boil over medium-high heat, then melt the butter into the juice. Brush the orange-butter mixture over the salmon, then place the pan into the preheated oven. \nBaste the salmon every 10 minutes with the orange-butter mixture until the skin is crispy and the meat is pink and firm \u2013 about an hour. Use foil to cover the fish\u2019s head or tail if they start getting too dark.\nWhen the salmon is done, remove the pan from the oven and pour wine into the pan to loosen the salmon if it has stuck. This also helps deglaze the pan to get the best flavors. \nLift the fish, using the cheesecloth, onto a serving platter. Discard the cheesecloth, and serve.", "We've already talked about them, but here's a lionfish, sometimes called a Zebra Turkeyfish.", "/public/fishfacts/913580192696508426_1920px-Pterois_zebra.png"], "11-24-2021": ["I want to do another mention of the flatfishes, generally called an order, Pleuronectiformes. These are your Flounders, Soles, Halibuts, Turbots, Plaices, Dabs, and Brills. Generally they are fish that migrate their eyes from one side of their face to the other. If you wanna hear more about that check out the flatfish fact on 6/20/21.\nSo there were like a million names I listed there. You may wonder, what makes one fish a flounder, and the next a dab? Well, friend, I'll tell you. Nothing. No rhyme or reason at all it seems. Sometimes people like to say \"flounders eyes move to the right side while soles move to the left\" or something of the sort. Well that's not true. The Arrowtooth Flounder and the Petrale Sole are both right-eyed fish (oh god look where we are again the Petrale Sole's binomial name is Eopsetta jordani, named after, you guessed it, David Starr Jordan). \nA scientist in 1892 wrote \"The flounders and soles are abundant throughout the year. In general the name flounder is applied to most of the flatfish brought in except the best of the flounders which is called a sole. The confusion in names indicates how impossible it is to give an accurate account of the fish without scientific names.\" \nAnd last but not least, a poem by one of my favorite fish authors, Milton Love. Titled: Soul Survivor: \nA sole sole on her soul did dwell,\n\"If I'm soul-less will I go to Hell?\n  Thus conversly I wish\n  To converse with an angelfish\nI would then be in Heaven, truth to tell.\"", "An English sole, a left handed fish.", "/public/fishfacts/913202911792734218_unknown.png", "A Petrale Sole, a right handed sole.", "/public/fishfacts/913203128768290877_unknown.png", "An Arrowtooth Flounder, a right handed flounder.", "/public/fishfacts/913203331751612426_unknown.png"], "11-23-2021": ["So if you add an apostorophy to \"why don(')t fish\" you get a few new results I'd like to talk about! \n\"why don't fish bleed\" uhhh, they do! Fish have blood and if you cut into them, they will bleed. There are a few species that have blood without hemoglobin, so their blood is clear, but they will still bleed. Sometimes when a fish gets cut, it bleeds very little, and that is because they have less blood vessels at the surface than mammals do. We use our blood to help with heat and to make sure our very dry outer layers still get oxygen. Fish don't worry about heat, and they live in water so don't worry about drying out. So when you cut a fish lightly, often they won't bleed until you get fairly deep. Also, fish are often small and simply have less blood, so that could be an explanation. \n\"why don't fish feel pain\" They do, and acting like they can't is sorta silly. Without an adverse reaction to negative situations, they would not live for long. See fish feeling pain fact. \n\"why don't fish freeze in Antarctica\" ooooo Remember the antifreeze blood fish?! Give that a search. Some fish do some crazy stuff to prevent freezing in below freezing water, like fill their blood with antifreeze chemicals. Check out that fact! \n\"why don't fish get electrocuted\" Hum... They do and can be electrocuted. I think something that people are thinking about is when lighting strikes the ocean, why does it not kill all the fish? Well, the ocean is a fairly good conductor, and a massive ground or earth. So, when lighting strikes the surface, it will rapidly spread across the surface, killing most things there (don't swim during lighting friends). But, any of the current that goes into the water is basically spread out so quickly that it's neutralized, causing little harm to fish. This is a bit different for freshwater, but I'm tired so I'ma leave it there.", "Gonna try the multiupload this time... We'll see if I stick with it. Whoops messed up this google screenshot.

I don't like talking about him much because he's sorta the worst, but David Starr Jordan. His most famous contribution to ichthyology was Synopsis of Fishes of North America, a book he wrote in 1882, honestly not really the most exciting book. He was a prolific educator, and there are people even still today who take pride in the fact that the person who taught the person who taught them was taught by David Starr Jordan. \nUnfortunately, along with actual science, he also taught quite a bit about eugenics. So that's neat. He wrote many papers with titles like \"On Behalf of Racial Purity\" And \"The Blood of A Nation\" that are disgusting. He expressed many fears about what he called \"race degeneration.\" Honestly real gross. Even worse, he taught these beliefs to college and high school students. He even had a hand in publishing the horrifyingly titled \"Sterilization for Human Betterment\" it contains even more horrors than the title lets on.\nHe also may have had a hand in the coverup of a murder, although it's sorta iffy. Jane Stanford (Yea, Stanford university Stanford) died on vacation to Hawaii, and the first person who looked at her body said she died of poisoning and that her death was a murder. Jordan himself went to Hawaii and hired a doctor who then said that she died of a heart condition.  He was president of Stanford at the time of her death, but was essentially fired from that position in 1916. It's generally accepted nowadays that she WAS murdered, but it's unknown why Jordan would have covered for the murder. \nHe's done some other good things in his life, including helping teachers unions, leading the Sierra Club for a while.

As a request- another google autofill, \"why dont fish\". This is likely two questions and they are slightly different. \"why dont fish\" has slightly different in autofill results from \"why don't fish\", with the apostrophe. \n\"why dont fish drown\" Fish have gills! The gills on a fish take the oxygen naturally dissolved in the water and use that to respire. It's like what we do on land, except rather than using air, mostly nitrogen with some oxygen, they use water, mostly water, just a tiny amount of oxygen. I've done like 5 fish facts on this one alone, check out the one about breaking the molecule of water (fish don't do that).\n\"why dont fish sleep\" Well, we don't know that they don't, in fact there's some evidence that they do. Just keep in mind that their brains are wayyyy different even in shape from ours, so the needs of their brains are not the same as the needs of ours.\n\"why dont fish sink\" It's complicated! Most frequently it\u2019s because they have a swim bladder, a pocket of gas that they use to regulate their density to move up and down in the water. Some fish, like sharks use oils in their livers to do this. Some fish, on the other hand, DO sink. They lack either of those two adaptations, and live on the bottom. No need to float if you want to sink. For a cute example of a swim bladderless fish, check out my Orangethroated Darter fact! \n\"why dont fish blink\" Well, most fish don't have eyelids, so they literally cannot. If you think about it, the main reason we blink is to keep our eyes moist. When you live in water, keeping moist isn't an issue. Some fish have something like an eyelid that serves the other purpose of an eyelid, protecting the eye. Some sharks have this, so their prey doesn't damage their eye as they are eating them.

Check out the fish senses facts! \n\"can fish see water\" So I can't ask a fish, but I imagine the response is no, not really. Just like humans cannot \"see\" the air they look though, I would imagine fish cannot see the water they look though.

They have a developed chemosensory sense They do not, however, likely differentiate between a sense of smell and a sense of taste. \n\"can fish see air\" I dunno! Probably, just like we can see the boarder between air and water, I would imagine they can see it. Their vision is adapted for being underwater though, and likely does not (for most species) work well when taken out of water. \n\"can fish see color\" Yea, probably. Most fish have light sensing cells much like that of humans so they likely see about what we do. However, there are exceptions. \n\"can fish drown in water\" I'm gonna just say yes on this one, if you want all the background and waffling about terminology, see previous fish fact. \n\"can fish eat bread\" Yea probably, but they shouldn't.

They need the Oxygen that is dissolved in water to survive. But, no, they aren't drowning in the same way a human does. We drown by flooding our lungs with water, they simply don't have lungs. Fish basically die as their body runs out of oxygen. Humans can have all sorts of lung garbage go on before they run out of Oxygen. \n\"can fish feel pain\" Yes next question.

This of course crashed the fishery and it is still struggling to recover. Many of the fish that are caught are very old, some live over 100 years. At times, rockfish were discarded in favor of other species, basically throwing away 100-year-old fish, dead. A bit sad. There's a story of lines of fish miles dead behind some fishing boats.

According to a few historians, he had a massive estate with an odd pool, in which he kept lampreys. \nLampreys are parasitic, I think there's a fish fact about them. They prefer to eat other fish, but will eat anything that bleeds if they are hungry enough. I think you may see where this is going. Pollio kept many slaves, and when they would simply make mistakes he would throw them into this pool, allowing the fish to essentially eat them. They would not survive this process.  \nThe story goes that Augustus (yea that one) was eating at Pollio's estate when a slave dropped a crystal cup. Pollio immediately condemned him to be fed to the lampreys.  The slave then broke down and begged Augustus to be killed in any other manner. The emperor immediately ordered all of Pollio's expensive glasses smashed in front of Pollio. The emperor filled in the lamprey pool. The tellings of the story differ, but he may have also freed the slave that begged for mercy. \nThis story is actually very common among Roman-times historians.

The shape of the head may allow the shark to have more sensory organs leading to better prey detection. The shape of the head may help the shark dodge stings from their favorite food, stingrays. The shape of the head may also help the ray move, giving them more control over the way they move through the water. All of those claims are likely correct and the head likely serves many purposes. \nMost species are endangered or critically endangered. Only one species is listed as only vulnerable.

It made me realize that it might not be super clear. Fish, at least as far as I know, require oxygen to survive, much like we do. We get our oxygen from the air, which is a mixture of different gases. The atmosphere of the earth is mostly nitrogen, with about 21% oxygen. We breath in this mixture, and pick the oxygen out of the air inside of our lungs. Makes sense. \nSo water has the chemical formula H\u2082O, two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. The science teacher thought that the oxygen fish needed was from the oxygen in the actual molecule of water. Nope nope nope nope. Fish do NOT break those bonds for oxygen generation. In fact, quite the opposite happens. \nBreaking water into its parts is possible. The process commonly used is called Electrolysis, it involved running electrical current through the water to essentially rip the bond apart. This would leave you with hydrogen on one side, and oxygen on the other. This takes quite a bit of energy. There are a few other ways, including biological ways. Plants break down water as part of photosynthesis. Fish do NOT derive the oxygen they need to survive in this way. \nThe oxygen they use is Oxygen that is already diffused into the water. Oxygen is literally mixed into the water, almost like it is in air, just in a much weaker concentration. Fish are just pulling the oxygen they need to survive out of the water, they are not generating their own oxygen from water.\nThe equation for respiration in animals in it's VERY MOST simple form is sugar+oxygen\u2192water+carbon dioxide+ATP.

Many, if not most other groups say that that is untrue. Most groups are citing the critical water shortage in the Colorado River Basin and increased human factors on the river. The international organization that most nations look to for conservation, the IUCN, still has the species listed as endangered. Not only that, but the IUCN states that the population is still in decline, nearing critical endangerment. \nMost of the protections for the fish remain in place, but some fear that the removal of this species is an attempt to begin more human interference in the already overburdened Colorado River.

Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (i.e., F.I.S.H.)! So, there's a lot to go over here- so let\u2019s start with the words used in FISH. Fluorescence is when a chemical emits or reflects light when exposed to something- common in biology. The phrase In Situ means where you find it, in the original place. Hybridization refers in this sense to the binding of florescent molecules only to certain biologically active molecules. Uhh... So it's when you add glowy chemicals into cells to make certain parts glow different colors. \nThis may at first sound pretty, but useless. But FISH has led to some huge leaps in biology and genetics. So, picture this. You want to figure out where in a genome (a genome is the WHOLE DNA sequence of species, in humans its 3.2 billion letters long) a sequence exists. You know that somewhere, the DNA has a certain code, but you don't know where. So, you make up or find some DNA that has the code you want to find. You add some markers onto your chunk of DNA. You take a cell and break apart its DNA, and squirt in the marked DNA you made. The marked DNA binds with the whole sequence of DNA where it can, where the gene would naturally be in the Genome. You then attach glowy colors onto the markers you added, and look closely for the glow! Where the glow shows up is where your gene is located! I know that sounds like gibberish, I recommend taking a look at some of the diagrams I'll post. \nThis was and is used often in science. It now can be used to define where and when genes are expressed, as not all genes are \"on\" all the time. Back in the day before genomes were completely sequenced it could mark where on a genome something was. It has too many medical implications to even discuss, I recommend reading the wiki page if you want a headache/want to know more. FISH was made possible (in a roundabout way) by the Nobel prize winning discovery of Green Florescent Proteins (GFPs).

To get the nutrients they need to survive out of their food, the absorb the nutrients though their digestive system. \nIn humans, the digestive system is pretty boring. So the mouth breaks down most food and adds some different things in your saliva to start digestion. Food goes to your stomach where acid is introduced to break it down further, and muscly walls smash and squish the food around. It then moves into the small intestine, where most of the absorbing happens. The small intestine is a long tube that worms its way around in your midsection, allowing lots of space to get out everything you can out of your food.

Back in the day, the way of preserving fish was to salt them. Leaving fish in tons of salt dehydrates and sanitizes them, making it less likely to break down. As you could guess, that changes the flavor and texture significantly. A group of 3 people built a boat, and using methods known for a long time began canning salmon on the Sacramento River in California, USA. They then moved their barge/factory to the Columbia River in Oregon/Washington, USA, and became a big deal. The first cannery was built in 1864, by 1883 there were 39 canneries on the Columbia River alone. In 1867 the first cannery was established in Canada on the Fraser River, British Columbia. \nThese canneries were mostly manned by migrant workers (mostly Chinese and Japanese), First Peoples, and Native Americans. Oftentimes this was for horrid wages and really bad working conditions. When machines began to take over for jobs humans used to do, they were named racist names associated with the workers they replaced. Surprisingly, canneries were a place where women were often seen working, although race played a huge part in that. \nCanned fish took a big hit with the invention of refrigeration, which can keep fish fresh for days. However, canned fish lasted well into modern times and are still produced in some places. The last big cannery on the Columbia closed in 1980.

I want to talk a bit about \"traditional medicine\". So this can be interpreted in many ways, and one is an assault on the culture or traditions of a particular people, country, or race. That is not my intention and should not be interpreted as such. I am trying to represent something that actually happens as fact. I will try to be honest, and at least represent things fairly, but I do have my own opinions and will not try and hide them. \nOkay, so throughout culture humans have sought to cure and treat various illnesses with basically everything, from just literal food to literal poison, with varying degrees of success. The way this effects fish is usually with dried fish and fish parts used to treat various illnesses. \nDried fish are used in traditional medicines all across the world, unfortunately there is one area of the world where it is most common, mostly Asia. China, Taiwan, and parts of Southeast Asia all are famous for this. \nThe WHO (World Health Organization) notes that traditional medicines are extremely important to many people in treating illness. They also note that many situations some of these medicines have actual active ingredients that are not integrated into the dominate health care system. However, they also note that some of these medicines are dangerous, causing active harm. They also note that many of these products are not produced in a safe manner. The WHO in my opinion, is extremely forgiving of traditional medicine. \nMany studies have found that there are all sorts of problematic effects of these medicines. A few of them cause active harm, many do nothing at all. They do play an active role in producing the placebo effect which is an important part of medicine, so should not be discounted. I also cannot deny that traditional medicine is a powerful tool for discovering active ingredients and chemicals that can save lives.  Tu Youyou is a noble prize winning chemist that found many of her treatments for illness using Chinese medicine. \nHowever, these treatments hurt fish populations. Seahorses, whale sharks, and many other endangered fishes are hunted exclusively for medicines that often have no basis in science. Seahorses have been hunted and populations have been destroyed simply because their dried bodies are used as a treatment for \"infertility\" and other things. These endangered animals are hunted to be an expensive Viagra. \nI personally think that while traditional medicine is an important part of culture, like everything, it MUST be undertaken with the protection of our world first. We cannot use it as an excuse to over-harvest species, cruelly keep species, or destroy ecosystems.", "Here's what the WHO says about it if you'd like to learn more!

That means that the young are often born helpless and remain so for a long time, needing protection from family. Humans are an example K selection.

Knifefish are a almost exclusive freshwater group. Most of them can produce weak electric fields that they use for communication, navigation, and locating prey (mostly inverts on the bottom). The exception is of course the electric eel, who produces large electric fields for prey capture and defense but we've already talked about them.\nThe electric fields are crazy and super interesting. Some fish can detect the electric fields, so the knifefishes often use super high frequency signals to hide from them as most of the freshwater fish are seeking out low frequency fields. But female knifefish prefer to select males who have lower frequency fields. So, males often will switch between the safer high and more dangerous low. When you put two kinifefish together that have the same frequency field, they will even change their frequencies to avoid jamming each other\u2019s signals!  Or, as some recent science is showing they may actively attempt to jam the signals of others they see as competitors!

So fish metabolize (break down) all sorts of stuff, including proteins, one of the main sources of nitrogen. As these break down, you produce ammonia, an extremely toxic compound, the same stuff you'd find in Windex. Wild fish excrete this ammonia out of their body and it is carried away by whatever body of water they are in. However, In human care you have to worry a bit more.\nThe most obvious way to reduce this is to change the water. If you take out some of the water and replace it with new, clean water, you'll remove some of the ammonia and help the problem. Fish keepers do this, but it's super hard work and you can't do it quickly, changing the water too fast will kill most fish. So aquarists rely on bacteria to help. Bacteria inside of fish tanks convert ammonia into Nitrites, a compound less toxic, but still pretty toxic. More bacteria can convert nitrites into nitrates, an even less toxic (but still toxic) chemical. Plants can absorb nitrates easily, so a planted tank will enjoy that. Some fish keepers call this Ammonia to Nitrite to Nitrate pathway \"The nitrogen cycle\" but it is rather obviously not a cycle. \nThese bacteria take awhile to grow, so introducing fish into a new habitat can be dangerous. Just dumping a bunch of fish into a clean habitat will cause ammonia levels to spike, killing all the fish. Most people have methods they call \"Cycling\" that they use to prepare a tank, but most take at least a month to prepare a tank. \nMake sure you do you research before getting any fish!

Been a long time since I have personally kept fish, so if you're a fish keeper with more recent knowledge message me and I can add your info! So there's a few things you have to stress about when keeping fish. Solutes, temperature, and nitrogen which is a solute but is a BIG one so I'ma talk about it separately. \nSolutes can be a big deal for some fish. Salt is a major one, how salty the water is can kill a fish quickly. Changing how salty the water is fast can also kill them. Most people track this and dissolve more salt water or add distilled water to adjust it. pH is usually caused by solutes in the water and is somewhat complicated. It measures the acidity or basicity of a solution. Most saltwater fish like their water slightly basic while freshwater habitats run the whole gambit from acidic to basic. Other things like minerals in the water, gasses in the water, and even other random salts can have an effect.  If you're thinking of getting started, I'd talk to a local fish shop about your local water and see what needs to be done to it to have it ready for fish. Some shops will even take a sample your water and test it for you! \nTemperature is important too, most fish you see will be tropical, seeking temperatures that would reflect that, mostly around 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F). Some fish, like goldfish, are considered \"cold water\" fish that are comfortable usually at wide ranges of water temperatures. Always do your research on what the fish likes, as putting a tropical fish into non-tropical water would be the death of it. Cooling and especially heating units are available, but are often the part of a fish tank that will fail first, I recommend investing in an expensive, high quality one. For like the few years I kept them most fish that I lost were due to the failure of bad heating units. \nI think I'll wait till tomorrow to talk nitrogen cycle.", "pH tests are often colorimetric!

I sorta disagree now, advances in filter technology have made saltwater animals easier, and freshwater fishkeeping has become almost as beautiful with some of the plants and planted aquascapes people have made. \nIf you are thinking about taking on a fish or many fishes there are some things you should think about before making that decision. Fish are a commitment! Many can live 10 years or more and will require on average about 4-10 hours a week of your time. Most, if not all, of your time, will be spent cleaning and changing water. Fish are often a financial commitment, with some lone saltwater fish costing into the thousands of US dollars, I've seen some upwards of 15,000$ before. That's just livestock too, not even thinking about equipment, aquascaping, and water and electricity that will be required to run the habitat.

Usually somewhere along the tail (though rarely at the end of the tail like many people think) you will find a modified scale, sharpened and covered in hooks that is a rays main defense. When at risk, a ray will try to shove the barb into whatever is harming it. Many rays have a strong venom that can cause pain, swelling, and some pretty significant damage!  Almost all ray stings are from people who step on rays while in the water, my recommendation is to shuffle your feet across the bottom when you're in the water, so you won't ever step down on top of a ray. If you get stung don't remove the barb, leave there and seek a doctor, the hooks on the barb can do some pretty big damage as it comes out. Wrap the area in a hot towel to help break down the venom. \nRays are almost all declining due to over- and unregulated fishing. Some rays are harvested and cut into perfect circles to be passed off as scallops.

So there is a myth in japan about namazu or catfish. \nThe story went that there was a giant catfish (sometimes called jishin-no-uo or earthquake fish) that lived under the islands of japan or somewhere in the mud. When that catfish moves, it causes earthquakes. A rather famous god called Takemikazuchi , enshrined at Kashima, Ibaraki, at one point restrained the catfish under a large stone. This prevents earthquakes for the most part, but when the god lets his guard down, the fish will thrash, once again shaking the earth. Oddly, this catfish isn't always seen in a bad light. During the 1800's, a large earthquake struck near Edo, modern day Tokyo. This destroyed a lot and likely killed many, but those who survived saw some significant benefits from wealthy landowners paying to rebuild. In a way the catfish is sometimes seen as a redistributor of wealth and is often portrayed with coins surrounding or around him. \nInterestingly enough, catfish do seem to be able to predict earthquakes. Up to Hours before earthquakes catfish can show agitation and odd behavior, noted by both 18th and 19th century sources in Japan, and modern tests. Some tests show the catfish are up to 80% accurate when predicting earthquakes, the mechanism that allows this happen is not known. \nOh, and apparently according to some of the Pokemon nerds in my life there's a Pokemon called Whiscash based off of this myth.

The most common way to do this is with a Chromatophore, a really specific cell. These cells usually are sorta star shaped, but only the center is packed with some sort of pigment. However, when stimulated, the cell moves the pigment to all parts of the cell, stretching the pigment out over a large surface area. Spreading out that pigment makes the color way more obvious, which changes their color! \nThe most common type in fish is called a melanocyte, and is simply full of dark pigment. This allows the fish to change from light to dark, and change the color for many different purposes, most notably camouflage. Other colored chromatophores exist too, and have complicated names like Cyanophores, and Iridophores, but the purpose and structure are basically the same. \nDifferent things can stimulate these, including actual signals from the nervous system. The most studied, however, is hormonal activation. Even in tissue removed from an animal we can still activate the chromatophores by adding certain hormones. This means that humans can use chromatophores as testing grounds to see if something could harm or change the way a cell works.

Matsya seems to be associated with various flood myths. Hindu mythology is complex and often symbolic, but most of the stories surround a fish (or fish/human or fish/god or just god that looks like a fish) that saves someone or something from a great flood. \nIn Buddhism it represents the freedom provided by water. Many Polynesian religions have fish or shark gods.  Pisces is an astrological sign related to the constellation Pisces, one of two fish constellations I can find (the other being Piscis Austrinus visible from the Southern Hemisphere).\nIn the book of Jonah, a book of the Hebrew Bible, a prophet named Jonah gets swallowed by a fish after being thrown off a ship.

These guys are native to the large river basins in South America, famously the Amazon. The name comes from Tupi language, it means \"tooth fish\". They are omnivores, they eat both plant and animal material. I say that first, because I'd like to dispel a bit of their vicious reputation. There are more than 25 species called Piranhas, so there can be some variation. Most of them are pretty small, with them in general ranging from 12 and 35 cm (5\u201314 in) in standard length (remember how to measure fish? Past fact callback!). \nOkay now let\u2019s talk eating! So, these guys have varied diets, although the majority is usually fish. They have been found with seeds, fruit, plants, fish, land mammals and birds all in their stomach at the same time, so they aren't picky. They have one of the strongest bite strengths for a fish of their size and can easily tear into their food with sharp teeth. Humans often tear into them though! They are commonly eaten throughout their range. Some fishermen dislike them as a pest fish, saying they steal bait for larger or more desirable fish. \nLet's talk a bit about attacks on humans, as they do happen! They rarely attack a normal healthy adult during a normal season. Attacks are more common during times of drought or lack of food. Human activity, like damming rivers also causes an increase in attacks. They are more likely to attack someone with an injury than without, and more likely to attack children than adults, almost all fatal attacks are on children. Fatal attacks are very rare, most attacks just leave behind minor injuries. The media much like sharks portrays them in a bad light, they likely cannot turn anyone or thing into a skeleton (although some stories like the one written by US president Theodore Roosevelt seem possible but over exaggerated).

So we've had some requests for some fishes of the Amazon! This first one is gonna be a doozy of a fact, so if your sensitive or prudish I would skip this fact. Geo specifically asked for the Candiru, so here weee gooo. So generally, these guys are parasitic catfishes native to large river basins in south America. Most are super small. They are usually blood eaters, draining blood from the gills of larger fish. \nBut Geo wouldn't have requested such a fish if it weren't for the stories around it. In 1829 an explorer in the Amazon heard (Never saw) that people would tie ligatures around their penises in an effort to stop this fish from swimming into their urethra. This same explorer suggested that it was attracted by the smell of urine. Tribes in the area did and still do wear various pieces of clothing while in the water, but why is not clear. The fish are NOT attracted to urine. \nAnother story goes that they would LEAP out of the water to embed itself into the urethra of unsuspecting folk who urinated into the river. This is obviously false and essentially impossible. \nSo, let's talk real evidence. There are a couple of very old cases noted by doctors of them entering into the vaginal canal that are likely credible. In 1997, a man claimed that one jumped from the water, into his penis (the urethra was far too small to accommodate the fish, it would have to of pried it open) then chewing its way into the scrotum. So, as you can tell, the doctors report here does not seem credible. The doctor provided some evidence, including a preserved fish with all of his spikes attached, although the doctor claimed that he had to cut the spikes to remove it. The doctor provided a cystoscopy video of pulling something out of a tube backwards, something that would have been impossible if the spikes were intact.

If you think about it for a bit, you'll probably see why that does not make sense. These guys breath with their gills, so there's really no way to hold their breath. The way they inflate is actually by filling their stomachs with water. It's important to note that they fill with water and not air, air would be dangerous for a puffer to take in, as it would make them float until they could get the air out.\nSo, they fill up with air as a defense mechanism. Being large and round makes something very difficult to swallow, think of eating a pizza vs a round ball (sphere) of the same radius. Even harder if the ball is spiky. \nKeep in mind, these guys are going to an extreme attempt to protect themselves. They actually compress their internal organs and stretch the tissues of their skin and stomach. So puffing up is not good for the puffer to do unless it absolutely has to.

The last few rays of the fin are modified into at tube that is inserted into the female to fertilize her eggs.

Guppies and Mosquitofish are good examples of this, both members of the same family. \nThe other similar example is the claspers of male cartilaginous fishes. These are modifications of the pelvic fins that are intended to insert into the female, and keep the two close during the transfer of sperm. As the pelvic fins are a paired fin sharks will usually have two claspers, only one is inserted into the female. The other is moved aside to help allow the one being inserted to function.

I should note that I am talking about physical pain as opposed to emotional pain like heartbreak or loneliness, maybe we can talk about fish and those sorts of things later though I doubt it.\nFor some reason in the past some philosophers have argued that because animals lack consciousness, they are unable to feel pain (looking at you Descartes). This is a different question, but I would like to note that consciousness has no definition that I could properly investigate in non-humans.\nFish check all the boxes for feeling pain though. The sensory organs used to detect damage and cause pain are called Nociceptors, and fish have those all over. Those nervous cells connect to the brain. Fish respond to pain relievers or analgesics. Fish have behavior and learning responses to situations that humans would deem painful. \nObviously, a response to pain is important. Avoiding physical damage is among the most important steps to passing down your genes. Most animals have some sort of avoidance to these sorts of responses. Fish who were purposefully harmed by introduction of acids into their water or saline injected into them respond with stress responses like faster breathing and avoidance. These responses are reduced or removed if you introduce morphine or other pain killers. Injecting bee venom into the lips of salmon makes them slow down and begin to rub their lips onto surfaces. \nZebrafish who have had salt solution injected into them even will prefer a barren habitat with morphine over a much more enriching habitat that they would prefer under normal circumstances, showing that they not only experience pain, but will go out of the way to alleviate it. \nSo, I mean... I guess that has implications like to fishing and other things, but I'll let you think about those yourself, I guess.", "Zebrafish show responses in color to acids, the lower image showing one that was exposed to a painful stimulus.", "/public/fishfacts/858492749694369842_Zebrafish_embryos.png", "When people do surgeries on fish pain killers and anesthetics are used to keep the fish out of pain. **WARNING: fish surgery**", "/public/fishfacts/858493132236390410_SPOILER_Fish_Surgery_281290596870529.png"], "06-25-2021": ["Protocercal tails are where the backbone goes all the way to the end of the tail with no lobes. \nHeterocercal tails are common in sharks.

Sorta rarely you can find it reversed, where the spine moves down the lower lobe of the fin- that's usually called Hypocercal.\nDiphycercal Is where the backbone extends past the unlobed fin, giving the fin a bit of a bump right in the middle of it. \nThe most common type of Caudal fin is the Homocercal tail, where the backbone stops before it ever reaches the tail, the tail being made up of rays. The backbone actually extends slightly into the top lobe, but that is rarely visible.\nThe Homocercal tail has a few categories. Forked is the most common, with the tail having two ends usually equal in length. Rounded- is pretty self-descriptive. Truncated, where it looks like the fin ends in a straight vertical or diagonal line. Emarginate is like forked, but does not fork quite as much. Lunate is my favorite!

Well probably I should go ahead and discuss the names of fins. So, here we go. From the face of the fish, we're gonna track back, across the top side of the fish and then down along the bottom.\nThe fin on the top side is the dorsal fin, it has many uses, but most notably it's important to keep the fish moving in a straight line and not spinning. \nThen we come to a fin that many fish do not have, the adipose fin. So this fin is still not well understood. Off the West Coast of the US, salmon hatched in hatcheries have the fin clipped off, with no obvious negative results. Some salmon seem to use their tail much more post removal though. The adipose fin seems to have shown up many times in evolutionary history, meaning that it's likely it does something because fish have developed it more than once. Many fish do not have an adipose fin.\nThe tail fin is called the Caudal fin. It is usually the most important fin in propulsion, being the fin that pushes the fish through the water. There are a few types, but I think that may be tomorrow\u2019s fact! \nMoving to the bottom of the fish, the fin towards the back of the fish on the underside is called the anal fin. It mostly helps the fish stay stable as it swims forward. \nThen we hit our first paired fin, the Pelvic fins! They mostly help to move the fish up and down, and to stop or turn quickly.\nRight next to the fishes\u2019 head, often on the side of the body you have another paired fin, the pectoral fins. Turning is the primary use, although producing lift, and even walking are important uses of them.\nSome fish have two rare fins, caudal keels and finlets. Caudal keels are on the caudal fin, but facing the other direction. Finlets line the tail from dorsal and anal fin to the caudal fin. Both likely help stabilize the fins and provide more force to swim with.", "Here's the wiki diagram for fins!

Inside these animals, men took form and embryos were held prisoners until puberty; only then, after these animals burst open, could men and women come out, now able to feed themselves.\" Uh... Okay? I hate to say that was dumb, because they were working with what they had, but many it seems dumb now. \nSo this is a fun one to disprove by simple science! Proof easily takes this one away. One of the examples is that people thought fly maggots spontaneously showed up on rotting meat, the rotting meat created the flies. So to test this, Francesco Redi in 1668 put meat into two jars. One he covered with cloth. The meat that was left uncovered had maggots and flies, the one without did not. Therefore, meat does not make maggots.

Many of those populations have suffered, and the pressure on the ecosystem has been felt. So, people have targeted smaller fish. Smaller tuna species, Pollock, Salmon all have become targets, next we move to a smaller species as those populations crash. \nSo, this can be applied ocean-wide, but does not work too well.

While it's true, there have been massive animals in the ocean that we have missed for many years, the impacts they had on ecosystems were observed. We see no sign of ecosystem effects from a gigantic predatory shark. Likely a shark of that size would need to eat like a whale or dolphin a day at least, and we haven't seen any of those animals vanishing in large amounts. It's just extremely unlikely that an animal with that large of an impact could stay under the radar for so long. \nThey MAY have gone extinct as recently as 3.6 million years ago though, which is fairly recent as far as how long sharks have been around (some estimates put them extinct 36 million years ago, not nearly as impressive)!  Changing climates as well as changing ecosystems likely killed this species. A harsh cooling period may have limited their range and reduced how well they could hunt.

So if you wanted to set up a human to get their oxygen from the water you'd have to basically hook up your heart directly to a gill- even if artificial. You'd have to basically replace your lungs in your circulatory system with a gill. \nThat sorta begs the question, why don't gills work in air and or why don't lungs work in water? The difference is between the actual physical characteristics of the two mediums. Water is much more viscous than air, so we've made different ways to get the oxygen. We basically have sacs we inflate like a balloon, easy in air because it flows easily out of small tubes. Water does not, so fish have gills that basically just have water flow over them. Water also has much less oxygen in it than air, so our lungs would have to work roughly 20 times harder to get the same amount of oxygen out of water than air, essentially impossible.", "Freshwater fish gill", "/public/fishfacts/841456756848721950_FreshwaterFishGill400x7.png", "Lungs, simplified and labeled", "/public/fishfacts/841457210341195776_lungs-anatomy-inscription-internal-organs-260nw-1716930082.png", "A gill diagram that I think I've used before but I like it", "/public/fishfacts/841457354670080050_Schematic-of-multi-scale-architecture-of-fish-gill-demonstrating-exchange-of-oxygen-from.png"], "05-09-2021": ["Mouthbrooding!

The most common effects are pain and redness. It can rarely cause death, especially in those allergic or young children.

Fish make up the majority of the venomous vertebrates, about 2/3rds of the venomous vertebrates are fish. \nMost fish deliver their venom via spines in their fins or by modified scales that are sharpened and shaped to deliver it. The most common spine to be envenomated is the dorsal spines (spines on the back). This is likely an adaptation to protect them from predators from above, and make their shape much more difficult to eat. Many fish have more than that envenomated though.

A female bonnethead shark was taken from the wild at way less than one-year-old and kept with two other females. A few years into being kept in human care, our female shark gave birth to a female pup. \nThis should be impossible. This shark was taken from the wild before she was sexually mature, and has never been in contact with a male since. There was no way her eggs were fertilized by a male. Some people thought that one of the other two species of shark in the habitat may have been the father, but after the pup died the real truth came out. \nThe pup had no DNA that the mother did not have. This shark was fertilized by the mother. The mother shark was reproductively normal. The fertilization happened via parthenogenesis.\nParthenogenesis in this case was \"automatic parthenogenesis.\" Two of the mothers' egg cells came together to form a complete genetic code. This is probably an adaptation for species like sharks who live in the ocean where they may never see another of their species to reproduce. Keep in mind that the reason for sexual reproduction in the first place is to mix genes to hide the bad genes and highlight the good ones, so automatic parthenogenesis is not really the best idea unless it's a last resort to continue your genetics. Because the mother had no y chromosomes, the baby will always be female as well. \nVirgin birth like our bonnethead has been documented a few times, but in the wild is likely more common than we think.

So, I often use the common name to name a fish, but there's a problem with that. There are fish with hundreds of common names for one fish species. Every language and region and even household can have a different name for a fish. \nOften the most commonly accepted common name is the one given by fishermen, but the problem with that is we end up getting things like starfish, whitefish, and everything named some sort of trout.  Not really descriptive, and often legitimately misleading. \nSo biology has what\u2019s called binomial nomenclature. It is often credited to Carolus Linn\u00e6us but that's complicated so I'm not gonna get into it. Long story short other people were already doing it before him but he did lots of stuff.\nFor fish, it's even more complicated. Often, you'll hear the default set of names, Domain, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species. Well.... That's hard for fish who have so many groups and types that there have to be subfamiles and Infraclasses and subclasses and superorders bleh it gets scary. What most people need to know is that most fish will have a two-word name. That will be the Genus and Species. A good example is Mola mola. Mola is the genus, and mola is the species (genus is capitalized species is not). The whale shark is Rhincodon typus. The Betta is Betta splendens.

The UK loves cod, they've gotta use it for their fish and chips. The problem is that UK fishing ships are not allowed into Icelandic waters. For many years this was not a problem, as international laws only had a nation's protected waters stretch a few miles offshore. However, the UK itself helped expand that range out. \nThe first cod war began when Iceland expanded its territorial waters from 4 to 12 nautical miles (7.4 to 22.2\u00a0km). All members of NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Association, an alliance with a variety of other nations that Iceland has) opposed this expansion. The UK sent military vessels with their fishing fleet to continue fishing. There were protests outside of the British embassy in Iceland, and the ambassador responded by taunting the protestors and playing loud bagpipe music. Icelandic patrol boats tried to remove ships from fishing in their range but often were met with the full force of the Royal Navy, something little Iceland could not contest. So they resorted to threats. During a time when NATO was incredibly important to both the US and the UK Iceland said they would leave NATO if they did not come to an agreement. The United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea between 1960 and 1961decided that Iceland could have 12 nmi (22 km), but with some space seasonally available to UK fisherman.", "The second plays out much the same way. Iceland expands its waters to 50\u00a0nmi (93\u00a0km) to protect fishing stocks. Patrol ships began to change off fishing ships. The Icelandic coast guard began using net cutters to cut the nets of fishing ships. Fishermen began to fight back by throwing rope trying to entangle the propellers of the Icelandic boats. They would blast \"Rule Britannia\" over the radio and refuse to identify themselves. The only fatality of the conflict happened when ICGV\u00a0(Icelandic Coast Guard Vessel) \u00c6gir\u00a0collided with a British frigate while trying to arrest a fishing vessel. An Icelandic engineer named Halld\u00f3r Hallfre\u00f0sson, died by electrocution from his welding equipment after seawater flooded the compartment in which he was making hull repairs. Iceland once again threatened NATO and the UK backed down, allowing the range expansion. \nThe third and possibly final war was in 1975-1976. Iceland, along with many other countries expanded its waters to 100\u00a0nmi (185\u00a0km). Then Iceland expanded its fishing protections to 200\u00a0nmi (370\u00a0km). This one played out much the same but had significantly more net cuttings and rammings than all the other wars. A British fisherman may have been killed by a cable snapping back on him when it was cut by an Icelandic patrol boat. The British in total deployed 22 military frigates, some with specialty hulls intended to ram. There was a total of 55 ramming incidents in the 3rd cod war. Once again, Iceland threatened to close its NATO bases and the UK came to the table to discuss. They agreed to keep out of the 200 nmi range as long as they could allow 24 vessels to fish 30,000 tonnes of cod. \nThe overall winner of the Cod wars is for sure Iceland.

The Canadian population used to be the largest in the world, some people said you could walk out onto the water on the backs of cod (not likely to be true, it's a deep-water dwelling fish).

Oarfish are a weird one. The most defining feature of these guys is their elongated shape, with the largest one recorded being 26 feet (8m).

Almost all human sightings have been animals that are dead or dying and have been caught or washed ashore. \nThese guys likely contributed to the myth of sea monsters. They would wash up on shore and be described in words as a massive snakelike fish monster, and people would run with it. There are some weird things about them. A report by some scientists in New Zealand reports that they gave electric shocks when touched. Something that hasn't been observed before or since.

The Mola used to be thought of as plankton. Plankton is frequently defined as any organism that is primarily moved by the ocean\u2019s currents. So, most fish are not plankton at least as adults as they can swim against the currents if they so choose. People used to think that the Mola was just moved by currents and therefore thought that they were plankton. With further study we know that that's not true, from the past fact you know that they swim pretty fast. \nHowever, many fish are plankton especially early in their life! Anything that is only plankton for a bit of their life is known as meroplankton (the opposite is holoplankton). A ton of fish do this. Often when looking at plankton nets you can find hundreds of larval fish. These planktonic fish are sometimes called Ichthyoplankton.

We're talking about *Mola mola*, the Ocean Sunfish.

They eat lots of stuff, a lot of small fish and famously jellies and salps!

So this movent is called Diel Vertical Migration, or DVM. \nThe reasoning behind this is light and energy. The sunlit layer is the only place where phytoplankton, the creatures that generate energy from light, can live. Phytoplankton form the base of the open ocean ecosystem. The problem with that is the sunlit later is super easy to get eaten in. Visual predators lurk and dart around, able to catch anything that is in the brightly lit water. So, if you want to both get the nutrients from the sunlit zone and stay safe you have to find a way to hide. The deep ocean only has one hiding spot, the deeper darker water. Every day the largest movement of biomass on earth is the movement of these animals up and down in the water, up to eat, down to hide (mostly, this is sorta an oversimplification). \nSo that means that these animals are taking HUGE amounts of nutrients down and up every single day. This has been named \"The biological pump\" and is extremely important to the planet-wide ecosystem. The deep ocean is likely the largest sink of CO2 we have, so the animals move carbon from the upper water where it will diffuse into the upper atmosphere to the deeper water, where it will be trapped for years, maybe even decades.

I'm going to try to tell the story rather than fact spam for this one. \nSo for basically ever sounding has been the way to find the depth of water. A long rod or a rope with a weight is lowered into the water till it hits the bottom. This would tell you the depth of the water and allow you to make charts of where a boat could safely go. \nDuring WWII technology to find things underwater became immensely important. So sonar was developed. Sonar is the use of sound to find things in the water. Basically, a noise is made underwater and you time how long it takes to bounce off the bottom and come back to the point where the sound was made. \nThis technology was amazing. They could find the bottom much quicker than with sounding, sometimes in just seconds. There was a problem though. Sometimes when testing sonar it would find a bottom that was hundreds of meters shallower than what sounding showed. Not only that, but this false bottom moved up and down depending on the time of day. \nThey had discovered the deep scattering layer. A species of fish called lanternfish, or Myctophiformes hangs out at depth. They are EXTREMELY numerous and have swim bladders that reflect sound well. These animals chase plankton that they eat up and down in the water column. This makes what looks like a false bottom to the ocean.

They are cartilaginous fish, in the same group as rays and sharks, but very different in many ways. Sometimes you'll hear them called ratfish, ghost sharks, or spookfish. All pretty good names for them. At one point they were abundant, but their population now is small and restricted mostly to deep water. Like 8,500 ft (2,500 m) deep.  \nThese guys are long, though most of their body is their long tail that gives them the name ratfish (at longest 4.5 ft.,150 cm, usually much smaller). Like their relatives' sharks and rays, they don't have any bones, instead relying on a skeleton of cartilage. Unlike sharks and rays, they don't have any type of scale. They often have a venomous spine used for defense. From their grinding teeth, they are likely carnivores who prey on things with shells (although like most deep-sea carnivores they are likely opportunistic and will eat what they can get). \nThey have all sorts of adaptations for deep-sea survival. Large eyes help them see, their lateral line system is prominent, and their bodies are soft and pliable to allow them to better tolerate the pressure. \nThey are targeted for a few reasons, in Australia and New Zealand where for some reason they are called whitefish and sold as food. (What is with those two and consuming cartilaginous fish like they're cod?) One odd use of them is their oily organs can be used to extract a clean oil that was used to lubricate guns (can't really find a good source to confirm this... Gun experts can you confirm?)! These pressures are nothing compared to the problem of bycatch. When fishing for other types of fish, mostly for eating, they can get caught in the same nets. That can be hard on a population like the spookfish, who can live up to 30 years. Make sure you take a close look at the seafood you consume and ensure that it's taken from someplace sustainable!

Electric eels are again not eels, they are a species of fish referred to as a knifefish. They live in freshwater only in South America. They are carnivores, eating basically anything small enough to fit into its face. \nThe main attraction to these guys is the electric part. They use this for a few reasons, to hunt, to stun, or kill their prey, for navigation, and communication. They have muscles and nerves that are stacked in such a way that it forms almost a battery, and they can use a nervous signal from their brains to fire them, opening ion channels and creating an electric field. The muscles used to do this are called electrocytes or electroplaques. In case you ever need to impress your friends when animals produce electricity it's called bioelectrogenesis.  \nThese can be fired in very small amounts to be used for navigation and communication. Disruptions or interference to a weak electric field can be a sign of another eel or an object they're gonna bump into. They can use them at slightly higher power to cause animals around them to twitch slightly, creating movement that they can detect to find their food. At full power, these electrocytes can be used to stun or kill prey or protect from a predator. 860 volts at 1 ampere is the most they can produce. Enough to possibly kill a human depending on where it is applied (usually .1 to .2 amp are considered lethal, but it's complicated).

They eat plankton and are commonly eaten by many different open ocean predators like dolphins, swordfish, tuna, squid, and birds. \nThese guys are famous for their escape mechanism. These guys propel themselves up and out of the water and use their large fins to glide through the air for short distances. On average they can glide for 50\u00a0m (160\u00a0ft), but have been known to be able to do 400 m (1,300 ft).

One type is inside of a channel that runs along a fish, and some are just scattered on the outside of a fish. \nThe canal neuromasts are helpful when there's a lot of water movement, as the canal filters out the background currents and flows. \nThis allows fish to detect movements in the water, in an effort to help them hunt or to avoid predators.

Rivers, streams, lakes, and ponds are all commonly (but defs not always) freshwater. The oceans and seas are usually saltwater. Remember that this is a scale, so some bodies of water can be only slightly salty. Slightly salty habitats are usually referred to as brackish. \nFish inhabit both, but are much more diverse in saltwater, probably because 97% of the water on earth is saltwater.  \nFish face different problems in both, primarily due to osmosis, the tendency of things across membranes (usually cell membranes) to reach a balance. In saltwater, salt wants to rush into the cells and water wants to rush out. In freshwater water wants to rush in and salt wants to rush out. Both of these are problems that are solved in various ways. \nFish probably started in freshwater, though there is some evidence that bony fish may have started in freshwater and moved into saltwater.

Switching between saltwater and freshwater has some crazy chemistry having to do with osmosis which we may have time to talk about in another fact. \nThis migration is super important for many ecosystems! The salmon take up tons of nutrients from the ocean and during their migration back upstream to lay eggs carry those up those streams to supply all sorts of animals along the way! Bears famously hunt them as they migrate. After they lay their eggs they die, leaving the nutrients behind to be taken up by all sorts of animals and plants!\nSalmon are famously eaten fairly often, and are both still wild caught, and increasingly, farmed!

Counter-current flow. This is the \"special plumbing\" I've been talking about in the gill and warm-blooded fish facts. \nSo to start, I should at least mention osmosis (hold on keep reading I swear it will be fun). Osmosis is basically JUST the movement of particles from where there are many to where there are few. So if you have two rooms in a house and one has 40 people in it, they're going to spread out to fill both rooms comfortably. The more crowded the room, the faster they'll leave.  Same with particles inside and outside of cells. \nSo if you have a bunch of oxygen outside of your blood it'll rush in quickly. If you already have oxygen in your blood it'll rush in much slower. The most oxygen is in the water as it enters the gills. So fish do something weird. They make sure that the most oxygenated blood touches the most oxygenated water. That basically \"tops off\" the blood. Then as you move through the gill, you'll find the least oxygenated blood coming in contact with the least oxygenated water. Because there's so little oxygen in the blood, what's in the water still rushes in. Without counter current exchange, you would only ever get 50% oxygenated blood, as it would reach an equilibrium between the water and the blood. By using it you can sometimes remove 90% of the oxygen from the water. Check out the diagrams, they do a better job of explaining. \nThe same thing works with heat rather than oxygen. Let the coldest blood touch the coldest parts.

Someone wanted to know about gills! Gills I can do! So fish gills are pretty cool.  Gills are located just past the head of the fish and are on structures called gill arches. They usually open just on the side with an opening covered by an operculum. \nThe gills usually have the thinnest blood-to-water barrier so they are basically where all of the things that require diffusion into and out of the water. Including oxygen transfer, nitrogenous waste elimination, and salt balancing.\nGills work by having water flow past small almost hair-like structures called gill filaments. The tissue of the gills is super thin, allowing particles to basically (this is a big basically, there's a lot that has been very simplified) just come in or leave the bloodstream or blood cells.\n As they go by the oxygen dissolved in the seawater diffuses into the blood. There is some crazy plumbing that assists that, the same system that helps with heat does that, but I think that'll be its own fact. \nGills are the main excretory organ in fish, playing the role that kidneys play in humans. Fish also have kidneys, so they also use those (maybe we'll get to this in a fact? I dunno).  They excrete ammonia and ammonium directly out of their gills (essentially peeing out of their gills-but they also actually pee). Fish usually (some very much do) do not convert the ammonia they produce into urea as mammals do, they just excrete it directly. We may talk more about this later. \nFish have two main ways of moving water past those gills. Buccal pumping and ram ventilation. In buccal pumping, you open your mouth to fill it with water, then close your mouth and force the water out past the gill. In ram ventilation, you just swim forward with your mouth open and let the water pass by your gills. The ram ventilators are the ones you hear about who can never stop swimming.

After the babies hatch, they'll latch on to mom and eat some of her slime coat, the layer that protects the skin from bacteria and viruses (see above fact).

So a circulatory system is what takes oxygen from where it's collected (in fish usually gills in humans lungs) to the rest of the body. For fish, this is going to be the heart that does the pumping and the veins and arteries that carry the blood, which itself carries the oxygen. \nHumans have what's usually referred to as a 4 chambered heart, with one side pumping blood to the lungs and one side dealing with pumping blood to the body. Fish hearts (usually) only have 2 chambers, meaning that they only have only one loop for the gills and the whole body. \nThis would be a good time to scroll down and look at any diagrams I posted as stuff can get confusing without an image to associate with it! \nSo, let's start as a non-oxygenated red blood cell in the heart. The heart will contract and squeeze, forcing you to the gills where you will acquire oxygen! Then you will be pushed again to the body where you will deposit your oxygen with the body. Then you return to the heart! Easy right? Well...\nAn animal needs the blood to be always flowing, or else some part of the body will run out of oxygen. Human hearts achieve this by having two parts to the heart, a lung side, and a body side, so flow keeps going. But fish only have one closed loop. \nThe problem with a single closed loop is that a heart pumps by contraction. If you think of the noise a human heart makes you probably hear the bum-bum noise of the two sides contracting one after the other. A fish heart only has one \"bum\" as its noise.\nIf the heart of a fish is currently contracted, no new blood can flow into the heart, it needs to wait to enter the heart until it's not contracted. Fish have an extra bulge next to their heart called the sinus venosus, a spot where blood can wait before entering the heart.

Dark stripes on their bodies make it look like chunks of their body are missing, braking up the obvious fish shape. Many lie-in-wait predators have odd stripes on their heads that makes them look really weird head on. Fish aren't the only animals that do this, when you think of disruptive coloration, think of a zebra. The stripes are meant to confuse predators. \nThis also applies to shape.

So many bony fish (not sharks or rays recall earlier fish fact) have an internal organ called a swim bladder. This is a sac filled with gas that allows them to regulate their position in the water. Add air to the sac and you're more buoyant, remove it and you sink.  \nSome fish have swim bladders that directly connect to their digestive system, so they just need to go to the surface and swallow air to fill their bladder. They can get it out in the opposite way. If you're thinking this is starting to sound like a lung, you'd be correct! Some fish can get oxygen out of it in that way. The swim bladder is where lungs started! So your lungs are likely  the equivalent of a fish's swim bladder.\nNot all fish come to the surface for their swim bladders. Some fish use crazy chemical reactions to pull the gas they need to fill their swim bladders from their blood.\nMoving up in down can be bad for this organ. Gases expand as you move up in the water column, and if you do that too fast it can become a major problem. You see this sort of thing on fish that are pulled up from the deep sea by fishermen. \nHumans use these swim bladders in a lot of things! Because they are filled with air, sound travels differently through them. Sonar, the use of sound waves to detect underwater things, therefore can detect fish. If you've ever seen a fish finder that is what it's doing! It also leads to the deep scattering layer, something spooky sounding that I want to save for a later fact. \nSwim bladders are high in collagen and are sometimes harvested for beauty products. Some beers use isinglass to clarify their drink, isinglass is fish swim bladder (making some beers non-vegetarian). Unfortunately, swim bladders, especially of endangered species are also taken for traditional medicine.

So, remember earlier we discussed how only the jaws of sharks fossilized? Think of how that could mess a scientist up. \nEnter helicoprion, my favorite fish fossil. The helicoprion fossils almost always form these beautiful spirals of teeth, starting small at the center of the whorl and getting larger as you move out in the spiral. The spiral was almost always all that was found, as the teeth were the only part that fossilized. \nSo people ran wild with this fossil. They knew it must be a shark because of what was preserved of it and where, they just didn't know where and how this tooth whorl was located. Many early reconstructions put the tooth whorl on the top jaw spiraling out, or the bottom jaw looking like some sort of tooth whip. Some of the more outlandish guesses put the tooth spiral on the dorsal (top) or caudal (back) fins. By a stroke of luck, we found a fossil that was so well preserved that we can see the cartilage. \nThis puts the tooth whorl firmly in the lower jaw, likely with just a portion visible, and the visible part slips into a slot in the upper jaw. This allows the shark to have a saw that could be used to cut into hard shells and eat the animals that built the shell. \nOur friends Helicoprion are all extinct. In fact not only is that genus extinct, but the whole order is also.

Most fish are covered in scales as discussed before, and different groups have different-shaped scales. There are 3-4ish major types of scale. One of the types is the dermal denticles of Sharks, and we already talked about that one, you can see a discussion up above. These are sometimes called placoid scales. \nThe two most common types of scale are cycloid and ctenoid. The main difference between the two types is the presence of teeth along the edge of the scale. \nCtenoid scales have these teeth  They aren't true teeth, they are just little bumps that run along the edge. \nCycloid scales are defined by a lack of bumpy edges. They are rounded and smooth. \nThose two types of scales are closely related and are often grouped together as leptoid scales. Completely separate from that is ganoid scales, the scales of ancient fishes.  These are diamond-shaped usually, and used as armor. They are thicker and stronger.

I had a request for \"Fish with Knees\" which I am going to use to talk about something I've wanted to discuss for a while: the main split in different types of (bony) fish! Remember that the cartilaginous fish are their own group. \nSo, here's the split- Lobe-finned Fishes vs. Ray-finned fishes. Lobe finned fishes have fleshy lobes that extend usually in 4 spots on their bodies that make up their fins. Ray finned fishes have spines or soft tissue that makes up their fins. The two names for the groups are Sarcopterygii and Actinopterygii. \nI want to focus on Sarcopterygii today though because they're the ones with knees. I could cheat here and once again explain that technically humans are part of Sarcopterygii, as all tetrapods came originally from lobe-finned fishes. Okay I will cheat then. All tetrapods probably trace their lineage from a fish-ish creature called Tiktaalik. He's extinct now, but had lobed fins that he possibly used to walk on land with! He lived during the Devonian, often called THE AGE OF FISHES.\nAs far as things we can for sure call a fish that is a lobe finned fish there are far fewer examples. The lungfish are lobe-finned, they use those bony fins to help them walk. The other example is coelacanths, still completely aquatic and water breathing. They were thought completely extinct for many years, and are often called living fossils. \nThere may be more on both Tiktaalik and coelacanths in later facts!

Catsharks! Catsharks officially are a family of sharks, with the official name of Scyliorhinidae. Catsharks are one of the largest groups of sharks, with probably over 170 species! The are bottom dwelling, meaning that they spend almost all their time sitting on the bottom of the ocean, a lifestyle called benthic (But be careful with this word, I might use it later in a different sense).  Like most bottom dwelling fish, they eat invertebrates that live on the bottom and scavenge other food if they can get a hold of it. \nCatsharks are easily confused with some carpet sharks; some carpet sharks live on the bottom and have similar patterns. The way to tell the difference is that the eyes of a cat shark are always pretty obvious as that's where they get their name. Cat sharks have weird looking long eyes, reminiscent of a cat. The other main difference is fin placement. Cat shark's dorsal fin (the one on top, think the fin that you see sticking up out of the water before a shark attack in movies) is set waaaayyy back on their body. \nOne of the more unfortunate things about letting mostly fishermen provide the common names of fish is that they often cause problems.

Messed up the first time sending it. I'ma talk a bit about fish camouflage, but take it one step at a time! The most common fish type is countershading. \nThis is a fairly common type of camouflage among fish, a light belly and a dark back. The point of this is so that the fish when looking up will camouflage in with the lighter top of the ocean or sky. When looking down the dark back will camouflage in to the darker depths of the ocean or the bottom of the body of water. This adaptation is very common among animals that live in 3D space (not stuck on 2D land). Because fish can have danger coming from above and below them, they need camouflage for both. Countershading provides a great means to hide from predators from the air as well, so you will sometimes see it on land animals as well, especially those who dwell in the trees (lizards often have countershading).\nSome fish take this to the extreme, and have bioluminescent organs on their undersides that glow with the same brightness and the light above, allowing them almost active camouflage from below.

Let\u2019s talk about fish bones! So having a backbone is part (sorta) of being a fish. But nobody said the backbone had to be made of bone. Fish have their skeleton mostly on the inside. For the bony fish they have a hard skeleton made up of bone, basically the same as most human endoskeletons. The order of bony fishes is Osteichthyes, but they are sometimes called Teleosts, as many of them are in the group Teleostomi. The classification gets wayyy complicated. These are your seahorses, groupers, perch, eels, clownfish, Mahi-Mahi, Bettas, batfish so on. There are a ton of Teleosts. \nThe other group doesn't have hard skeletons, but they still have to have a backbone to be a fish. They cheat and make their endoskeleton out of cartilage, the same stuff that makes up your ears and nose (If you want touch your ears now if you can wash your hands before doing so, remember not to touch your face with unclean hands. Feel how you can bend your ear but it still bounces back to shape.). That means that They can bend their bones just like you can bend your ear, but only to a point, the cartilage still can break. Most use this to their advantage, using cartilage ribbing to help the bounce their tails or fins back into position after using muscles to move them. These guys are your sharks and rays (and a few others we may talk about later), Chondrichthyes is their order. That's why when a shark decomposes, all you have left are teeth and jaws, the only hard part of a shark. The rest is cartilage.

Fork length measures to the shortest section of the tail, usually where the tail forks. Total length goes to the very end of the tail. Science usually uses standard length. Fishermen usually use total length, as it makes their fish seem bigger. I've only seen fork length used once or twice, usually for a specific purpose- like if the fish has an unusually shaped tail.

Seahorses lack scales, opting instead for bony plates that cover their whole body. Their fins have been reduced or for some fins are completely absent. Because of the lack of fins, they are pretty poor swimmers and opt instead for using their tails to hold on to branchy objects. \nSince it's Valentine's day I should probably go into seahorse courtship, which is long and complicated. It lasts several days depending on the species, with a male and female hanging around (and on) one another. The long courtship dance ends with the female inserting an ovipositor (egg-laying tube) into a males pouch and laying up to 1,500 eggs inside of the male's specially made pouch. \nThis is where you get the story that male seahorses get pregnant. This is sorta true I guess, but it is not true pregnancy. The male only holds the eggs, he does not nourish them. \nAs the eggs are laid, the male releases sperm into the pouch, and the eggs are fertilized. The eggs sit inside the male for 9-45 days, depending on the species. The female continues to check on her mate daily in most species. Once the eggs hatch, the male pushes the babies out of his pouch and leaves them to fend for themselves. \nThis adaptation is probably in an effort to share energetic requirements for reproduction. If you remember the first fish fact, females spend a lot of energy making eggs, so caring for those eggs after they're laid would be even more cost on top of that. Having the males do it shares that energetic burden. It can also allow time for the female seahorse to develop new eggs, as growing and forming new eggs takes a lot more time than sperm. \nSeahorses face many dangers, including habitat destruction, being caught as bycatch, capture for food and aquarium trade, and they are often harvested for traditional medicine.

Today we talk about slime! Almost all fish are covered in a coating of slime, used mostly to protect the fish. The slime probably limits the amount of fungal, bacterial, and viral infections that make it to the skin. It also can help prevent parasites from attaching to a fish. Some fish have more slime than others. \nThis is the reason that when you're working with live fish that you want to keep alive you touch them directly as little as possible. Touching the fish scrapes off the layer of slime, leaving their skin and scales open to attack by all sorts of bad things. So, the next time you go fishing, do your best to touch the fish as little as possible if you're releasing them. Try to never touch pet fish. \nGreen moray eels are a weird example of fish slime. They are actually a brownish color, but the slime that they secrete is a yellowish color giving them their characteristic green look. \nHagfish, again only sort of a fish, have some of the craziest slime around. About 3-4% of a hagfishes' mass is slime. Just so much slime. When under stress or in danger they secrete even more, meaning that they can quickly become slimy messes.

When he was first starting out, he wanted his contribution to science to be finding testes of eels. He killed over 400 eels and cut them open searching for their reproductive organs, finding none.

Final definition fact then! \"Usually covered in scales\" leaves a lot of space and I think you can already see why. You've seen eels and hagfish already, both of which completely lack scales. So it's pretty clear that this isn't hard and fast. Interestingly, there are like 4 types of scales, the most interesting in my opinion being dermal denticles. Dermal denticles are what sharks have. There can be hundreds of thousands of these covering a shark's body. The word denticle has the same prefix as dentist, so I think you may be able to guess where this is going. Each one of those denticles is basically a tiny tooth. They are made of dentine, the same stuff your teeth are made of, have roots, and are covered in a layer a lot like the enamel that covers the outside of our teeth. Dermal denticles are there likely for two reasons. Their shape makes tiny vortices which reduces drag, making them much faster. Some swimsuits try to recreate this and have actually had to be banned in the Olympics for uncompetitive advantage.

So far I owe Rudy, Flash, and Ardi specific fish facts, but if there's something specific you want a fact about feel free to reach out to me!"], "02-09-2021": ["Alright! So next up is gills. The phrasing of this one is purposefully wiggly because of how many exceptions to this one there are. Gills are the way a fish breathes, they're basically thin membranes blood flows through so it almost touches the water. The proteins and compounds in the blood pull the oxygen dissolved in the water into the blood, and the heart pumps the blood around the body (fish hearts may be a future fact). If all you need is a thin membrane to transfer oxygen, all of a sudden you've got more options than just gills. Air usually has WAY more oxygen in it than water, so many fish have tried to figure out ways to use that! One of the more common examples is the Siamese Fighting Fish, or the Betta (side fact: it's pronounced beh-ta and not bay-ta). These guys in the wild live in shallow streams and ponds that often have very low oxygen concentrations. So they do something weird, they swim to the surface and gulp air. Their digestive system uptakes the oxygen they need from the air. This is actually why bettas are often kept in bowls or cups of water that would easily kill almost any other fish. Because they don't need oxygen in the water its quality doesn't matter as much. I've got some strong opinions on Betta care, but I'll restrain myself. Just always do your research before getting a pet. \nOther fish have adapted almost lungs! The lungfish have modified air bladders that they (with one exception) always fill with air to get their oxygen. Their gills are mostly useless. These modified air sacs are probably the beginnings of the modern vertebrate lungs that you have inside of you! \nMany fish also have some way of breathing through their skin as well, but that isn't an exception to the definition as their primary way of getting oxygen is still their gills.", "Bettas- these guys have been bred by humans to be as beautiful as possible.

Yea me too. So, you think you have appendages developed as fins huh? So fish have sorta screwed this one up. There are tons of examples of where this doesn't happen. Many eels completely lack fins aside from what is almost a tail fin. Batfishes have adapted their fins into almost little legs, as have tripod fish. Flying fish use their fins to glide through the air. Anglerfish have fins that are shaped like food to lure prey! Some fish have even adapted a fin to act as a sort of pseudo-penis to deliver sperm. I'm going to save lobe-finned fishes a later fact I think.

The next part of the definition is that fish are vertebrates- animals that have backbones and some other stuff- and good news, there are no real exceptions to that rule! Well... Sorta. There's this one thing. A Lancelet is a type of animal that is often considered the ancestor of all vertebrates, it has many of the traits that a vertebrate has. A lancelet has a backboneish thing (for sure not a real backbone, but close) and even gills (not for breathing but for feeding). Fish likely evolved from Lancelets. Lancelets are cool, but I consider them a fish ancestor and not a real fish.\nEdit: I forgot about hagfish! Hagfish are another fish-ish thing that only sorta has a backbone! Hagfish are pretty weird so I'll come back to them later for a fact I think.", "Here's a lancelet- weird little dudes", "/public/fishfacts/808034078078795856_unknown.jpeg", "A hagfish- lots to talk about with these guys", "/public/fishfacts/808037524797784114_unknown.jpeg"], "02-06-2021": ["I think I'm feeling like I'll keep going with exceptions to the definition, so that means next up is \"an aquatic animal!\" This rule is a little more hard and fast. I can't think of something you'd call a fish that is only on land, but there's some that sometimes are! \nThe ancestors of tetropods (anything with four legs, frogs, mammals, reptiles, even you) have early lungs and can survive on land for a long time! Some lungfish are obligate air breathers. They have damp skin and slime so they have to stay a bit wet though.\nEels, mudskippers, catfish, sculpins, and famously the Northern Snakehead can all hang out on land with different degrees of success. Most of these fish either respire through their skin or they use parts of their digestive system to breath (this probs will be the fact if we talk about gills). Northern Snakeheads, a freshwater fish native to Asia, have accidentally been introduced to multiple places, including the United states. They're quite hard to control, because they can and will literally get out and walk across land to a new body of water, spreading their invasiveness.\nThere's only one shark that can hang out on land, the epaulette shark! They hang out in shallow reefs with strong tides, so as the water lowers, the shark can get trapped in shallow pools. They survive by shutting down their organs so they don't need oxygen and then basically walking across to a new spot!

Now that we have a nice hard definition for what a fish is, lets break it! So, let's start with cold blooded.\nMany fish buck this! Some of the most famous examples are Tuna, who sorta regulate their body temperature! They basically use neat blood pluming (talking about this may be a future fact) to keep the heat that is generated inside!  Swordfish have muscles behind their eyes that rapidly contract generating heat to help the eye and brain function. \nThere's one fish that takes this to the extreme, the Opah! The Opah has similar plumbing to the Tuna, but they also have fatty tissue surrounding their organs and gills, like mammals, to allow them to retain heat! \nBeing warm blooded can help them survive in cold oceans, when the rest of the fish are slow due to the cold, they can zoom around and still catch their prey!", "An Opah!", "/public/fishfacts/807317665601421342_kUhb8.png", "A swordfish eye- it's really large- demonstrating how important vision is to them as a predator! **WARNING mild dead fish**", "/public/fishfacts/807318132552499210_SPOILER_Ra877ae9c7ddbacc6b3ab0a39bad35562.png"], "02-04-2021": ["Okay, I realized that I probably shouldn't give fish facts before first giving the most important fact about fishes: There's no such thing as a fish. Science and especially biology likes to define animal groups by genetic grouping. So, if we identify a group genetically that includes goldfish, sharks, parrotfishes, and  Coelacanths, we end up including all terrestrial things with a backbone, including you! Because humans, dogs, cats, sheep, horses, elephants, lizards, frogs, salamanders, and snakes are all animals with a backbone, technically they'd be fish. So, chances are, your fursona is a fish. \nBut, I knows a fish when I sees one. So people have tried to define what exactly it is that we call fish! Soooo... Here's my working definition: A cold-blooded, aquatic animal with a backbone with appendages developed as fins whose chief respiratory organ is gills and whose body is usually covered in scales. If you know anything about fish, you probably are already thinking of exceptions to this definition! I ask that you let them be that, exceptions rather than falsifications. Plus, I can use some of these exceptions for future fish facts! \nSorry for the doozy of a fact today... Had to get that one out of the way!

Groupers, wrasses, and my favorite parrotfishes all are commonly Sequential Hermaphrodites!
