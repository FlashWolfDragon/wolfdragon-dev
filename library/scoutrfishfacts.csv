So a few people in Florida are sending in photos of a super dried out dead fish that looks really scary. As the fish has dried, the teeth have become visible and the skin has dried to a dark color. As soon as the photo started to make the rounds, all sorts of names came up, snakehead, piranha, and of course, the supernatural ""demon fish."" 
Anyway, it's a bowfin. Native to Florida. If you want more info on them, check out the Dec. 2, 2021 fact!!",
1043948753859649616,2022-11-20 17:59:38.550000+00:00,"Okay, so it's time to own up to some fish facts! As my opinions and discussions have become more developed, I'd like to clarify a few things about Traditional Medicine. I don't think my original fact was exactly fair. I used some language that could be pretty unclear, and that hinted at some bad ideas and concepts. 
So, just to clarify, some traditional medicine does have ways of working that are tested and known to our evidence-based medical system. But these things are in the minority. This does not mean that traditional medicine is quackery. Instead, what this means is that it helps people in a way that the evidence-based medicine I'm personally familiar with either does not take into consideration, or that it does not understand yet. In many ways, the evidence-based approach has a lot of growing to do, especially in the realm of the use of placebos. 
Frequently you find stories of traditional medicine being used as a last resort for someone who is dying and is seeking final comforts in knowing every possible was tried. Often these medicines, while the mechanism is unknown and likely a placebo, have observable, physical effects. These medicines help people and it's not for me to say that they are wrong. 
As someone who has made their life in North America, I should note that this is not my problem to solve.  Traditional medicine is just that, a tradition of a culture I am not part of. While I can look at its effects on the animals I love, I cannot comment on the traditions or on the effectiveness of the medicine. In fact, I think that teaching others about this could be somewhat dangerous. Studies done now about education about traditional medicine in conservation organizations have shown that frequently people leave with racist attitudes. Content warning, Racism: ||People have said things like ""Those Asians always killing things to get boners"" or ""Why don't the Chinese know that it doesn't work?""|| Absolute horrible stereotypes. I will leave my fact up, as discord has a different reach than those organizations had, but I've only chosen to do that after much thought. If you are someone from not those cultures who is reading the fish facts, I do ask that you realize that it is not your job to comment on those things. However, the taking of animals for those purposes is something those places and people need to resolve or those animals will go extinct. 
But don't worry my fellow North Americans! We have SO many conservation problems we are doing as cultural norms that we should do to protect animals. The one off the top of my head is the American/European tradition of having a ""lawn"". A modern lawn is usually a relatively flat area covered by a single species of short-growing grass. Even then, the grass must be cut short so it grows no more than 5 cm in height. A whole industry has arisen around this process. Huge amounts of land have been dedicated to growing this grass to put into lawns. Hours of time either by the lawn owner or by people who are paid by the owner are spent on the maintaining of this space. And the two worst things for fish, gas power tools and fertilizers. Often the cutting tools for lawns are powered by small gas engines that are extremely inefficient. Meaning that cutting a lawn can produce tons of carbon dioxide for only the purposes of... appearance, I guess? I've talked about fertilizers before, but lawns seem to absorb less than half of the chemical fertilizers given to them. Meaning that all that extra nutrient goes straight down the drain and into waterways where it can harm fish.",

I'd have to find a service that works, but maybe I could put something together. If you're interested, could you give me a üëç on this one? I'm just trying to get a read on if this would be something fun.",

That said, I think I'm going to have to slow down on the fish facts for now. I think rather than trying to push one out every day, I'm going to switch to only doing a fact every so often. Maybe weekly, maybe monthly, really just whenever it seems to be important or when I get a request. It's not that there aren't more fish facts, I could likely keep going until I die. But there's just not quite enough time.  Thanks to everyone who took the time to read the facts. And thanks to everyone who reacted to the facts too! I really really appreciate them.",
938928762177871932,2022-02-03 22:47:41.356000+00:00,"GUESS WHAT?! Today marks one year of fish facts!!!!!! The first fish fact was sent out on February 3rd, 2021! I think for this one I'm going to try and review some of the facts. 
The first fish fact was about sequential hermaphrodites! What a weird fact to start with! We then sunk deep into what makes a fish a fish. A series of random exceptions to the rules kept going for a few facts after that. 
We then did some random species facts! From slime to seahorses. As we went through we talked about some of the things like scales, fins, and fossils! 
Some deep-sea adaptations too, like bioluminescence, cold seeps, and hydrothermal vents! Hagfish and hearts. We've discussed the human uses of fish, like fish oils and of course eating fish. There were like 50 facts about cod alone. Goldfish and carp dominated the facts for a while too! Lots of pop culture fish, from the holy mackerel to goldfish the snack food (BTDUBS the first ingredient in goldfish is smiles had to get that correction in). 
We talked about fish in science, and even in space. The fish that help make our medicine and test for pollution. We talked about fish that are gone and fish that are near gone. We've talked about fish who invade and push out other fish. We've talked about how we can help fish and how we hurt them.
Not to wax poetic for too long, but  I think it shows some of the coolest parts about studying animals. We as humans are inexorably linked to fish, just as we are to most everything alive on the planet. I hope if you've got anything from the fish facts it's a new appreciation of some animals who often don't get the spotlight.  Thanks so much for going on this journey with me!",

The whole plot takes place underwater with a variety of anthropomorphized fish. They are hideous in appearance, with human faces and fish bodies. We follow Oscar, a Bluestreak Wrasse who wishes to be rich and famous, but instead works at a ""whale wash."" Oscar is voiced by Will Smith. He gets in trouble with some sort of shark gang, and eventually ends up accidently dropping an anchor on the neck of a shark, killing the shark. He then becomes popular as people think he murdered the shark on purpose. Eventually his love interest gets kidnapped and a nice shark and Oscar stage a rescue. He loses his popularity but the nice shark gets accepted by his family. Oscar goes back to the whale wash and works there, presumably until his death. 
On release, the show received 36% positive reviews. It was criticized as the shark crime family is depicted with Italian stereotypes.  It is pretty bad. There are also some really bad representations of black people.  The nice shark subplot was often interpreted as a story about accepting homosexuality in families, and was therefore protested by many groups including the American Family Association. Will smith won a Kids choice award for best voice actor, and it won an award for its voice casting. It was nominated for best animated feature, but rightly lost to The Incredibles.",

This is most likely not great advice. The fishing industry is essentially 24/7 nowadays, and shipments can come in to modern supermarkets whenever. In dealing with seafood sellers, I've found that a few of them had specific delivery times on Saturdays and Mondays most frequently. So in my own experience it's not really great advice. 
Not to mention that even when the saying originated you had a pretty good chance of getting not fresh seafood whenever you went. There's no real way to tell outside of asking when the fish arrived at market or was caught. So not shopping on Monday does not save you from bad seafood. Bad seafood is everywhere and all the time.
Have a good February!",

According to their website, they own and operate more than 600 restaurants, hotels, casinos and ""entertainment destinations"". So cool. As far as seafood places it is the second largest behind only Red Lobster. They are currently owned by Tilman Fertitta, a multibillionaire. 
If you live in the US, chances are you live near a location they own. As far as food places go, they own: Del Frisco's, Mastro's Restaurants, Morton's The Steakhouse, The Palm, Strip House, Vic & Anthony's Steakhouse, Bubba Gump Shrimp Company, Claim Jumper, Houlihan's, Joe's Crab Shack (I don't know if they still own this one I don't think so?), McCormick & Schmick's, Rainforest Cafe, Saltgrass Steak House, Atlantic Grill, Grand Concourse, Jake's Famous Crawfish, Babbin's Seafood House, The Boathouse, Blue Fin Seafood, . Of course, they also own Landry's. Honestly, they own so many more but I don't really want to list them anymore. 
Anyway, the reason why I wanted to bring them up is that their food places often feature fish! Many of their places have large fish displays, which you probably know if you've ever been into a Rainforest Cafe. They have their hands deep in the fish industry. Landry's owns the ""Aquarium Restaurant"" chain, which includes some pretty big players in the Aquarium industry, including the Downtown Aquariums in Denver, Colorado and Houston, Texas. Also, they have locations in Kemah, Texas and Nashville Tennessee. 
So those that know me or who have been reading fish facts for a while know that I am at least slightly in favor of Aquariums. My personal opinion is that they do a great job of connecting people to animals that otherwise would feel distant and alien. That connection allows them to move towards conservation of those animals and the waters they live in. That gets complicated though when you look at a leviathan like Landry's Inc. 
These aquariums are for-profit. The end goal is usually to make money. I think that frequently that can get in the way of conservation messaging. Especially when you are more concerned with selling seafood than showing the sea animals. That's my opinion though! Who knows?",

At one point, there was a giant fish habitat that went all the way around the Miami Marlins baseball stadium. It was controversial, as many worried that the windows would break, or that the sound and vibrations would injure the fish. The windows are not a concern, they were made of acrylic plastic, easily able to withstand a baseball hit even by a pro. Sound however is an issue, as it likely can at least cause stress in fish. The fish and tanks were removed in 2021, without a reason given. My guess is that it wasn't for the health of the fish, fish and habitats are extremely expensive to maintain, and likely required staff specifically for the care. I think they removed them to save money.
There is also a fish tank in the Tampa Bay Rays baseball stadium, holding what look like cownose rays. Sometimes balls fall into the tank as home runs. They may have not come back after the pandemic though, they did not show for the 2020 season, and I can't find info for 2021 or 2022, my guess is that they didn't come back.

It used to be found from mid-Ohio all the way up the river and its tributaries, as far as North Carolina and New York. Like most darters, (see darter fact) they are sensitive to pollution and human activities, and that pushed them out of the western part of their range, and they hadn't been seen in Ohio itself for many years. This is likely due to industrial pollution. 
The fish were last seen in Ohio in 1939, since then they were believed to be extirpated from the region, locally extinct but still alive elsewhere. BUT good news! Just this year there were fish captured in Ohio, meaning that they have returned to their habitat. There was one captured near Stratton, OH. 
This is almost certainly the effect of the Clean Water Act of 1972, and a harsh reminder of how long habitats take to recover. Protecting aquatic habitats is hard, and often requires harsh laws to prevent industrial pollution.",

Methuselah is a lungfish that lives at California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, CA, USA.  Methuselah arrived from Australia, which makes sense, as she is an Australian Lungfish (I've talked about these guys in past facts, lungfish are pretty cool). She arrived at the Academy of Sciences in 1938, just 7 years after our not friend and famous racist David Starr Jordan (see his fact for more info) died in the same city. Her actual age is unknown, but she has been there for 83 years. I'm using female pronouns for Methuselah, as those are what her keepers use, but even they admit that they don't really know. They have sent scales off to test for sex and see if exact age can be determined. 
The past record for oldest fish in human care was held by Granddad, another Australia lungfish, who had been collected in 1933. Granddad lived at the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago IL, USA, and arrived there for the ""A Century of Progress International Exposition"" which was held there in 1933. Granddad died in 2017, passing the oldest fish torch to Methuselah. 
Methuselah was named after the Bible character, known for being the longest lived mentioned in the bible, 969 years. According to the fun articles written about her Methuselah enjoys eating figs and even some direct contact and touching from her keepers. Lungfish are estimated to live to about 100 in the wild, so she's on the upper end of her lifespan, but may have a few good years left.",

935735073494433803,2022-01-26 03:17:06.638000+00:00,"Fish generally have small brains relative to body size compared with other vertebrates, typically about (0.06 per cent) the brain mass of a similarly sized bird or mammal, although that is not always true. Most fish brains are composed of around 5ish lobes! From the front of the brain to the back, they are usually the olfactory lobe(s), diencephalon, telencephalon, optic lobe(s), cerebellum, and myelencephalon. Each part serves a different role (we think)! 
The olfactory lobe probably receives and processes signals from the olfactory nerves, so mostly taste/smell. Diencephalon does some hormone stuff and regulates homeostasis. The telencephalon is still a bit of a mystery, and may have something to do with social behavior as its larger and more pronounced in fish that are social. The Optic nerve deals with all things eye. Cerebellum is weird and complicated, likely doing many different things all at once. It for sure has something to do with electrical senses though, as we can see it used when those senses are used in the fish that have them. The Myelencephalon controls some muscles, and seems to play a big part in respiration and osmoregulation. 
Fish brains are pretty cool and are supper odd, though you can see some similarities to even the mammal or human brain!",

Step one is to remove as much as possible. If you're focusing on something like bones, you want to remove large organs like the eyes and guts. Then you get rid of ALL the water. Like as much as you can. Usually this is done with a soak in something like 95% ethanol. Then a stain is applied. Common dyes include alizarin red which binds to calcium to dye bones, and Alcian blue which dyes cartilage blue. 
Then you gotta get rid of the tissue, the ""clearing"" part. So often trypsin is used, trypsin is the same stuff that many vertebrates (including you) have in their digestive system to help break things down. Trypsin breaks down most proteins, but leaves one of the most important, collagen. Collagen is structural, so the shape of the fish is maintained, even though all of the color breaks down and is dissolved. Leaving behind basically just Jell-O in a perfect fish shape. 
Once the process is done, you usually store the specimen in glycerin, which has the same refractive index as collagen, which makes is basically disappear. This process is important, as it shows the 3D arrangement of bones inside of the animal. It's helped with differentiation of species, telling one from the other. It's also helped a lot with biomechanics, how different parts move between each other.",

Sometimes you'll hear people call them Weberian ossicles, and that's because it's mostly made of bone.

934527119009148969,2022-01-22 19:17:07.846000+00:00,"Okay, ice fishing! So in many parts of the world, especially in North America, the ice that covers lakes offers a new opportunity to fish. The fish are often more willing to take bait, and you can get your fishing equipment to places that'd be hard to get to otherwise.  
This has turned into a whole thing. Native Americans and First Peoples would use spears and clubs to catch fish after breaking the ice with axes. Nowadays, ice fishing is mostly done by hook and line. An auger, usually gas-powered drills a hole in the ice and a fisherman drops some sort of bait down into the water. Sometimes an ice saw is used to make a bigger hole. Usually this is some sort of Jig, which is moved around in the water too look like something living, or a Tip-Up, which suspends bait in the water without even needing a human there. 
Many places have huts or shelters that will be placed around the ice holes, these are usually simple and used to keep warm, but some are extremely complex and include bedrooms and even bathrooms. Some shelters are only tents. As it is usually very cold, it's important to keep your fishing hole from freezing over. There's a tool usually called a skimmer that is used to break up and remove ice on the hole before it gets too thick, but below about -20 F (-29 C) it becomes almost impossible.
Ice fishing does have quite a few dangers! Obviously falling through the ice is a big issue. It's recommended never to go out onto ice thinner than 4 inches, (10 cm). It's recommended to be 7‚Äì12 in thick (18‚Äì30 cm) for light cars, and 14‚Äì16 inches (36‚Äì41 cm) for full-sized trucks. Sometimes huge chunks of ice break off and can float away, stranding fishers. Warm spells can cause ice to weaken, making it easy to fall through. If a fishing hut isn't properly set up, carbon monoxide can build up inside it too.",

So the Tequila fish is a small live bearing fish related to the splitfins. The name does not come from the ability to swim in the booze, they are actually quite sensitive to pollution. They are only native to a small area in Central Mexico, they were thought to live in rivers, and even then, only the Ameca River basin. They are named after the Tequila 
 volcano that sits nearby. Unfortunately, the past tense of that last bit gives away the bad news. The fish was essentially extinct in the wild. They were no longer found in the rivers they used to live in, and were thought to be completely gone until a small pool was found with about 50 individuals in it. They were likely killed off by introduced species, pollution, and habitat destruction. 
Before they vanished, they were taken by aquarists, hobbyists and professional researchers alike. The population was maintained, and has recently been re-introduced to the Teuchitl√°n River in Jalisco, and seems to be doing well, and growing! The population was introduced in late 2020 though, so the story can change so fast. A recent study on the newly released fish showed that almost all of them shared more than half of their genetics, meaning that inbreeding and the problems associated with that will likely be a problem soon, if not now. 
BUT, if this works, then it could be a blueprint for other fish species that are gone in the wild. If the Tequila fish could survive after being gone from the river for over 20 years, then maybe the Golden Skiffa, a close relative also native to the Rio Teuchitl√°n, could come back too!  There's many a golden Skiffa in Aquariums, Zoos, and private collections just waiting to return if it's safe.",

So in many freshwater lakes in the far North and far South, as well as some rivers, the winter months bring a thick layer of ice. This covers the surface of the lake. 
That layer of ice does not go all the way down. The deeper you go, the less likely the water is to freeze. The ice insulates the water below it, and the pressure prevents it from freezing easily. That makes sure the fish below the ice don't freeze. If a body of water is small enough to freeze all the way through it won't support fish life. 
The ecosystem does not rely on the surface for survival, while there is less food after the lake is sealed off with ice, there is still input of energy from the sun, and the fish often will pre-prepare all summer and spring, gaining weight to survive for winter. They still eat all winter, catching anything they can. 
Another thing I've heard is that fish will die because there is no oxygen exchange from the air. While I'm happy that someone remembers that fish require oxygen, they forgot something important. Cold water holds more oxygen than warm water, so even without the exchange of oxygen, they still are doing just fine.",

So the group of cartilaginous fishes is called Chondrichthyes. It includes all sharks, rays, and if you remember from many facts ago, the chimaeras. Oftentimes it is contrasted with the Osteichthyes, the boney fish. 
Chondrichthyes is a class, and it is split into two subclasses, Elasmobranchii and Holocephali. Elasmobranchii is sharks and rays, Holocephali is the chimaeras. You may have seen or heard me refer to a shark or a ray as an Elasmobranch, that's why. It's not really that descriptive of a term, but it's a common one. 
Often Elasmobranchii  is divided into 3ish superorders. Galean
sharks (superorder Galeomorphii) includes Orectolobiformes, Lamniformes, Heterodontiformes, and Carcharhiniformes.  The rest of the sharks are called Squalomorph sharks (superorder Squalomorphii). The rays, for some reason, are usually just called rays (sometimes superorder Batoidea). 
Geebus that's a lot of garbage, and it doesn't even go into the cladistics of extinct Chondrichthyes! I felt like I needed to mention that info because if you're ever talking to a shark biologist they immediately start tossing those terms at you.",

933048470984593459,2022-01-18 17:21:30.685000+00:00,"Torpediniformes, Electric Rays.  There are 69 (nice) species in four families. Sometimes they get the name crampfish or numbfish, the word torpere means ""to paralyze"" in Latin, which hints at the purpose and strength of their electrogenic capabilities. 
They eat fish and inverts like crabs, lying in wait and then using their electricity to shock their prey. 
Electric rays have huge electric organs on either side of their body, taking up a good chunk of the round disk that makes up their body. The organs essentially build up a charge like a battery and then discharge the electricity all at once when needed. The organ is made up of many gelatinous columns that act as batteries individually. The largest rays can produce voltages around 220 volts, at around 30 amps. That's a lower voltage but higher amperage than an electric eel, most people think that's due to different conductivities between the saltwater the rays live in and the freshwater the eels live in. The method of generation is slightly different too, check out the electric eel fact! The eels generally have their generation set up in series, good to overwhelm the strong resistance of freshwater. In salt water, the rays have the organs set up in parallel, as the strongest resistance is the organ itself. But the saltwater is so conductive they need really strong current to produce any results. 
In ancient times the shock from the fish was used for various things. In humans it usually causes cramps, or numbness, not anything too dangerous. There is some evidence the Ancient Greeks used them to help numb pain during childbirth or surgeries. In Compositiones Medicae written in Rome around 46 AD, they are prescribed for headaches and gout (they likely don't help with either). 
Before electricity was discovered, they were thought to be magical. They were taken as evidence that nature had abilities far beyond what humans would ever understand. However, that all changed with Henry Cavendish, a famous scientist who did a LOT of stuff. He proved that he could produce the same effect using batteries, proving that the rays used electricity.",

We talked about the types of shark orders, and listed 8 orders. what we call ""rays"" are usually about 4 orders, Myliobatiformes, Rhinopristiformes, Rajiformes, and Torpediniformes. We already talked about Rhinopristiformes, those are the sawfish! 
Myliobatiformes are essentially your default rays. They usually have rounded bodies, and the tail that you probably picture when you think of a stingray. Most species are benthic, meaning that they live on the bottom. These rays are the ones most commonly responsible for stings on humans, as they live coastally and on the bottom, making them easy to step on. Short-tail stingrays and Southern stingrays are common examples of these species. It's important to note that this is a very diverse group, with the giant, not rounded, not benthic Manta ray in it, so a lot of the ""Usually(s)"" I'm throwing out here are not very usual. 
Rajiformes, the skates. Another group we've talked about before! Skates generally lack the barb that stingrays have, and are usually shorter in tail length, and usually more fish-like in appearance. Check out the Skate vs. Ray fact for more!

932037294658052136,2022-01-15 22:23:27.462000+00:00,"So, let‚Äôs talk catch and release! This is a practice where after catching a fish on a hook, if fishing recreationally it is somewhat common to release the fish back into the water alive. If one likes to fish for pleasure or recreation, it's probably the best way to fish for the animals and their habitat. 
However, one should keep in mind that catch and release fishing is not entirely safe for the fish. Oftentimes there are many problems that could cause the fish to die during or after being fished. Some are impossible to avoid, others can be prevented. Let's talk factors that kill fish.
Sometimes you're just working with a delicate or already stressed fish. If the environment is having problems, or the fish is sick, the fish will already be close to death before you catch it and the stress and exhaustion from being caught will kill it. Not much you can do about that, but try not to go fishing during times where fish will be under a lot of stress. Think about the weather, avoid fishing during times when the water is especially hot or cold. 
Where the fish was hooked is also important. A properly caught fish should have the hook pierce them though their lips, thin tissue that will not cause too much of a a problem and will heal quickly. However, sometimes fish swallow hooks and they pierce them though their throat or stomachs. The hook can also pierce the gills. That will likely kill the fish. Fishing properly can reduce the chance of this happening, but if it happens the best thing to do is to try and remove the hook using pliers or a disgorger (a special tool for this purpose). 
If the fish is caught in deeper water, it will have some serious issues due to the swim bladder. You can pierce it to help, but it's iffy on if that solves the problem. See the swim bladder fact for more! 
If you keep the fish out of water too long, play with the fish, or over exhaust the fish too much, the fish will likely die. Handle the fish as little as possible as every finger touch will wear off some of the fish‚Äôs slime coat. Only ever handle fish with wet hands. Keep the fish wet, and be gentle but firm with your touch when you do have to handle them, dropping the fish is likely worse than gripping it.",

They are found in the tropics and subtropics of the Atlantic, including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean. They have disappeared from much of their range though, and are likely gone off the coast of Africa where they were once more plentiful. 
They feed on fish and large inverts like crabs. The big saw is used for fish capture and manipulation, in similar ways to our saw sharks like we saw earlier! 
They are Critically endangered. They are targeted by shark finnners (ironic because they are not a shark), easily entangled in nets and trash, and super slow to reproduce. 
 The population's off of the Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi coasts has essentially vanished, although it is showing slow signs of recovery. The only place where the population seems to be stable or on it's way to recovery is Florida, where strong public information campaigns have protected it from the worst. We know the population used to stretch to South America, but there hasn't been a sighting there in hundreds of years. YOU can help by reducing the plastic you use, making sure the seafood you eat is sustainable (a good rule of thumb is to get seafood from countries with strong fishing laws, USA, Canada, UK, ect.) and obviously NEVER participate in the shark finning industry.",

Let's start with something I mentioned in the last one, Sawfish Vs. Saw Sharks. Again, A sawshark is a shark, a Sawfish is a ray (or its own thing entirely depending on who you ask). 
The easiest difference is the gills! Sawsharks have their gills on the side of their body, like you'd expect for a shark. Sawfish have their gills on the underside of their body, like you'd expect for a ray. 
Sawsharks have two sizes of teeth, longer teeth that are alternate with shorter teeth between. Sawfish have only one size. 
Sawsharks are small and live in deep offshore waters, while saw fish get huge and live in mostly coastal waters. Sawsharks are poorly understood but likely doing okay. Sawfish are in danger from overfishing and overharvesting.",

Pristiophoriformes, the Sawsharks. They are really cool looking guys, usually very recognizable. They usually have NO anal fin. Of course, the most noticeable thing about them is their rostrum, the huge section of their nose that has their teeth sticking off of it. Oddly we still don't know exactly what it does, but we think they can hunt by thrashing it side to side immobilizing prey. We know so little about these species that almost all of them are listed as data deficient on the IUCN Red list. They live pretty deep, so don't interact with humans often.  Okay now is time for a brief aside, there is also a group of fish called the Sawfish. Sawfish are not the same thing as sawsharks, sawfish are a type of ray in the group Rhinopristiformes, not really a shark.
Squatiniformes, the Angel sharks. One of the weirdest shark groups. They are small, the largest barely reaching 7 feet (2.1 m). The majority of the body is flattened, but elongated when reaching the tail. Weirdly, rather than having the upper lobe of the caudal fin elongated like most sharks, many of these guys have the lower lobe. They have spiracles and no anal fin. Unfortunately, due to fishing both as bycatch and as the target species, many of them are critically endangered.",

Lamniformes, the big bois. These are called mackerel sharks. They often look like a mackerel, with an almost lunate (moon-shaped see fact about caudal fins) tail. The great White is the most famous member of this group still alive, although it was likely the Megalodon was in this group too. Weirder members include the goblin shark and the megamouth shark.
Squaliformes, the not so big bois. This group gets very little attention. It's home to the Dogfish, lantern, rough, and sleeper sharks. Most are fairly small, especially when compared to the Lamniformes. Two of the groups in this order have bioluminescence, unusual among sharks.",

A weird one is the scale eating fish. It's called Lepidophagy, and it usually describes a fish that eats the scales of other fish. Surprisingly, it's rather common among fish. 
Most fish that specialize in Lepidophagy have all adapted (separately, most are not related to one another) some common traits. Specialized jaws for gripping and scraping off scales is a must-have. Often, as you find with most of the cichlids that specialize in this, they will mimic the patterns of their prey fish, allowing them to get close to their prey and then pluck a few scales. Some fish have special enzymes specifically to help them digest scales.
Most fish get scales by basically plucking a few off the side, either by ramming into them or by sliding up to them and sneakily stealing some. 
Lepidophagy is an odd niche. While scales are pretty good for fish nutritionally, they offer some pretty dangerous tradeoffs. You need to be sneaky or fast enough to get some scales. You risk aggression from the fish you're trying to steal scales from. Not to mention you rely on other healthy fish as your only food source. Lepidophagy  really only shows up in healthy, complex ecosystems that have high competition, or extreme environmental conditions.",

What is in fish that causes this is really not understood. Most people think that it is caused by toxins in some plants that are eaten by the fish. Most of the fish that cause it are herbivores, which supports that idea.

This creates a long lasting but not permanent color. This method has a very high mortality rate and is only done with super cheap fish that can afford to have an over 50% mortality rate. Often some catfish or pleco species are treated in this way. 
Obviously don't do that either. Some fish companies now make a product that is made of natural color enhancers, usually carotenoids  that make their natural colors more vibrant.

So, aquarium fish are a big industry. Most aquarium fish are bred in Southeast Asia in ponds pools and tanks. Millions of fish out of Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, and most notably Singapore. This is the best case scenario in my opinion, better bred in human care than captured from the wild. 
But a major problem of commodifying living things is that life is limited. To get new types of fish you have to go though years of selective breeding and perfecting, not exactly the instant product-to-market that makes profit fast. 
So, the solution was to modify the fish in other means. We've talked about glow-fish, but that's not really that bad. The problem arises when you try to do other things. Injecting used to be the most common. 
Fish with light or no color would have color injected just under their skin, like a tattoo in humans. A large bore needle was used. This would often kill the fish right out, but if the fish survives it would often have a shortened lifespan. 
This is a very cruel thing to do to fish, fish are very small, and the needles used are often very large, the equivalent of injecting a human with a needle the size of a pencil. It's not needed. Please, if you see fish that have been modified in this way avoid buying them to help reduce demand for these fish. (remember that not all bright colored fish are ""painted"" or injected. A good thing to do is ask, although not all sellers will be honest.)",

Other colors were developed later, yellow and grey. Unfortunately they have been one of the fish species that have been injected with color to make them more interesting (more about this later). 
Like flowerhorns, there is much Ado about them. People don't like that they've been bred to a point that many of the features could be considered deformities. They have tiny mouths making it hard to eat. Some fish are injected with color, and others have their fins trimmed into a heart shape. Both of these modifications cause problems for the fish, and usually shorten their life. Most fish sellers now refuse to sell them. There are some breeding efforts in place to try and fix some or the irregularities and deformities in the breed, though they are slow. Just like flowerhorns, males are generally infertile and require treatment to even breed. 
They are hardy though, and can often survive almost abusive conditions. Like all aquarium fish they should be provided sufficient space, food, shelter, and clean water. They are often considered a ""messy"" fish and require frequent suctioning of their substrate.",

Medaka were launched into space to hang out aboard the International Space Station. 
Turns out, fish don't do well in space! Just days after the arrival into space, they began losing bone density. Osteoclasts, a type of cell that breaks down bones in response to damage in an attempt to repair skeletons show up in much larger numbers than they ever should just days after they arrive in microgravity. Oddly osteoblasts, cells that build matrices that bones form around also increased significantly. 
That probably tells us that something really weird is happening in fish when they enter microgravity. A gene is being expressed in a way that it probably shouldn't, or multiple genes are being turned on when they shouldn't or something. There aren't the enough tools in space to test that yet. More spooky to humans is that because humans a fish are closely related, this may have impacts on humans who are living in microgravity
The last time people asked about them on an ISS live, the scientists in charge of the experiment gave each other a weird look and told the kid that asked about them that ""there aren't many left"" which likely means they are all dead.",

The first fish brought to space was some mummichogs and their eggs. Upon arrival to Skylab (an early space station) they began to spin in constant circles. They did this for 2 days. That's likely because their vestibular system, the thing that tells them if they are facing up or down is now telling them the equivalent of ""AAAA."" Over time, they write themselves to the light that was on them, with up being towards the light even when the light was moved. 
Oddly, humans who got ""space sick"" usually vomiting due to low gravity feeling very uncomfortable, felt better almost exactly at the same time as the fish stopped spinning in their circles. That likely means that the same thing that causes humans space sickness causes the spinning in fish, but that's just a guess.
The fish eggs that were sent with the fish never spun. After hatching they followed the orientation of the lights. 
While I can find no conformation on this, I think those fish died in space. Later experiments would show why, but I think I'm gonna bring that up in a later fact.",

So I'm not sure if you remember a few facts ago when I was discussing fishing in the UK/France in the times of Brexit, but there's been an update! A deal has been reached with Euro fishers being able to fish UK waters until at least 2026, but with the vast majority leaving by this year. At 2026 the UK may decide to bar Fishermen from the Eurozone, but the EU has made it clear that that would mean they would stop importing fish from the UK, about 70% of the UK's fish goes to Europe. 
And, it seems, the UK is starting a bit of a fishing cold war. The UK government has announced they are using around 75 million UK pounds to modernize and improve fishing in the UK. That's usually would be good news for Scotland, home of the UK's largest fishing industry. However, Scotland seems a bit angry about it. To quote the BBC-
> ""While the Scottish government said the investment was welcomed, it criticised the UK government for spending in an area devolved to Scottish ministers.
> 
> Rural Affairs Secretary Mairi Gougeon said: ""It is for Scottish ministers, accountable to Scottish Parliament, to make decisions about how marine and fisheries funding is spent in line with our priorities. ""
There also is a bit of anger from Mairi Gougeon about Brexit in general too, as she goes on to explain that she would have preferred to not have to deal with all the weird garbage and just be part of the EU.",

However, what this person may have been thinking of was eyespots or false eyes, patterns that fish have that look like eyes. These are a type of disruptive coloration (remember that fact?). The eye spots can make a predator confused at the shape, size, or orientation of a prey item, often making it harder to catch for a predator.

Fried Carp has been reported as a dish served sometimes for Christmas in Austria, although less common today than in the past. Italy is known for its Festa dei Sette Pesci, or feast of the seven fish. It often features carp and eel, but also many things that we here in fish facts do not consider fish (octopus, clam, mussels, ect.). Spain usually does some sort of seafood soup, fish stew is a popular one in many central European countries as well, like Czechia. The Scandinavian counties are famous for their tables, boards, and buffets. Finland has joulup√∂yt√§, usually a central dish of ham with lutefisk and gravlax, two fermented fish dishes we've talked about before. Sweden has its famous julbord, usually with some sort of pickled herring and sometimes with a fish course of Gravad lax med hovm√§stars√•s or R√∂kt √•l (the first is a cured salmon with dill and mustard, the second is a regional dish of smoked eel). Sorry Norway and Denmark, couldn't find much info about you- on to the Baltics. Lithuania has a meal called k≈´ƒçios, often stated to be meatless, although it frequently contains fish, herring in tomato is common.

The Mekong River winds its way through Southern China and into Southeast Asia where it makes some crazy boarders with a bunch of countries. It is a pretty special river as far as large rivers go, with a really odd drainage pattern. It makes itself a really important and interesting river both geopolitically and as we know biologically. 
The Giant Catfish isn't found anywhere but there. Oddly, they are one of the only catfish without barbells as an adult, so they are a whiskerless cat. They used to be the largest freshwater fish, but that record has since been taken from them. Oddly, they are thought to be herbivores who scrape algae off of rocks. They lack teeth so there's not much more for them to eat. As juveniles they probably eat plankton.
They use to be extremely important to the people who lived along the rivers. There are stories of them being plentiful along the river, feeding many people. The people who used to fish them have noticed declines too, last reporting 5 caught in 2000 from what used to be hundreds. Some people in Thailand have an almost religious reverence for the fish, and it appears in quite a bit of art. 
As we know, exploitation and damming have made them critically endangered. Much of the river has no sign of them, and the parts that do have signs are few and far between. Many urgent projects are currently being undertaken to figure it out.",

923354394479718450,2021-12-22 23:20:42.739000+00:00,"Okay, let‚Äôs talk dams. Dams have had a pretty significant uptick recently, with huge projects going up in South America, Africa, and especially Asia. In North America and Europe, the dams that were built are already established and have already done their thing.
Dams are important to humans, as they provide lots of electricity for essentially no cost to humans. (This is not true; dams displace tons of people but we aren't here for people we're here for fish) There are tons of costs to the animals that are in the water. 
Freshwater habitats, especially moving freshwater habitats (Rivers, creeks, streams) are very delicate. They require constant flow or the whole ecosystem essentially becomes a lake. This is something that dams cause, but dams also literally block movement. Large river animals rely on being able to move up and down the river to survive. Dams literally stop this. This causes what is known as habitat fragmentation, where you've turned one habitat that was large enough into two habitats that are not. Unfortunately, that effect is well documented in fish. 
Salmon are probably the biggest and most obvious example. Dams in the Pacific Northwest of the United States and Canada have cause collapses in the population of salmon, because they no longer can access their egg laying grounds. We're now seeing the same thing happen to fish in the places that are building dams now.
The Mekong River Catfish is a HUGE animal. We're talking 293 kg (646 lb) big. These guys rely on the river for feeding and breeding, so the large increase in dams is expected to reduce the population by about 40%. Trick with that is other activities including fishing and habitat destruction has reduced them already by 80%. The government of China has already started conservation efforts, but it may be too little too late if we keep building dams. Damn.",

These pairs were set up, and allowed to bond. Then, the pairs were separated, and placed in a habitat with another cichlid, not their pair. 
The separated cichlids showed significantly more ""pessimistic"" behavior. Being much more likely to interpret neutral signals as negative, mostly.

Sharks inhabit coastal areas, and that is their home. We should be careful when we enter the ocean, but we should not compare sharks to a global pandemic. 
Anyway, sharks kill on average 10 people a year, much less than that in 2020 and 2019. COVID so far has killed 805K people in the US alone. So it's not even comparable. I don't think it's a very good parable. Anyway, I worry that it adds to the myth of dangerous sharks.",

The name bogue refers to the weird eye that they have, usually meaning bug-eyed or bulge eyed. They are commonly locally fished, but really don't make it to international markets very often. 
They mostly eat things that dwell on the bottom, worms and whatnot. They are a mid-level consumer, so they are pretty good food for bigger fishes, especially coastal sharks. Their main predator is humans though, we fish like 35,000 tons a year. They have weird gut flora that quickly take over the flesh, so they don't keep too well.
Boops the genus only contains two species, Boops boops, and Boops lineatus. The word Boops comes from the Greek Œ≤œåœâœà which means cow-eyed.",

Grass carp are easy to grow on farms. They eat basically anything, including easy to grow and feed grain. They grow to a large size, and are fairly easy  to eat. They are usually not eaten in the US or even really in Europe, but they are common in China and somewhat through East Asia.",

Milt is a mixture of sperm and a variety of other things, different depending on species. Milt also refers to some of the sexual organs of male fish.
I reference that because milt is eaten throughout a few different cultures as a delicacy. While milt is only rarely eaten on its own, it is commonly used as a side dish or even a spread. Famously it's eaten in Japan, sometimes called ÁôΩÂ≠ê shirako, which translates weirdly to white children. It is eaten similarly in Korea where its name is usually Ïù¥Î¶¨. In Europe, it's commonly fried or used as a spread. Fried in Romania and called Lap»õi. In Russia the word –º–æ–ª–æ–∫–∞ is used and means milk.

So today I want to discuss a book that I don't like very much, Fish is Fish by Leo Lionni.
This book sounds like it would be a fun romp through what makes a fish a fish, but no. The book opens on fish and Tadpole, as Tadpole changes into a frog. Fish watched this, and begins to imagine a fish in different situations. Some examples are: winged, like birds, and with legs like a human. Eventually, fish decides that he will try something new and leap onto land. Obviously, fish begins to die, and after about 2 pages of Fish dying, newly legged-Frog uses his legs to push him back into the water. There is very little discussion about what makes a fish a fish.
My problem with this story is it's an endorsement of staying in situations that you dislike. At the end, we learn that even though fish wanted to try new things, that was stupid and he would have died if frog wouldn't have been there. If you take it out of context of a children‚Äôs book like others did for rainbow fish it feels sorta like an endorsement of almost like feudal system. While Frog may get to move to the upper class of land dwellers, Fish is forever destined to remain a water dwelling peasant. Or maybe its just a story about not overreaching. Either way it sorta rubs me the wrong way.",

Fish eggs are fairly simple, they mostly consist of 4 things. Yolk, the food for the developing embryo. The embryo itself, which has lots of parts and stages we are not going to talk about. Space to develop into, often called perivitelline space. Then, surrounding them they have a shell, called the chorion.
The yolk is the bit that is important for development. This is a packed nutrient sack for the fish to grow on. Usually it's full of basically everything the fish needs, including sometimes an oil globule, a packet of oil to help provide energy. The embryo is protected from the outside world by the chorion, and grows into the perivitelline space until it can't anymore, and then hatches. Fish usually hatch with their yolk still attached.
The cool thing about fish eggs is you can see basically the exact same thing in other vertebrates, animals with a backbone. Amphibians, like frogs and newts and whathaveyou have eggs that are identical. Even birds, with their entirely land-based reproductive strategy basically have a fish egg encased in a goopy water like case. The goop inside a chicken egg that turns white when you cook it is lacking in fish eggs. It's basically a protein soup surrounding the actual egg that mimics water. Around that there's a shell to lock in water.
So once again, everything is basically a fish.",

The story focuses on the Rainbow Fish, a fish with many colored scales. The main focus of the story are shiny, reflective scales often in the story covered in a shiny foil. 
In the story the Rainbowfish is solicited for their shiny scales. At first, the rainbow fish refuses to give away his scales, but loses his friends because of it. He is told by some random sea creatures that he should give away his scales. He does, and he makes many friends but gives away all but one of his shiny scales. They are more happy with his new friends than they were with their shiny scales. The tale is often interpreted as a cautionary tail against vanity.  Recently, there has been some pushback to the book. Some folks have claimed that the book promotes socialism, or even communism, with the rainbowfishes natural wealth being distributed to those who don't have any. I mean, I guess. But I think it's more a message about sharing than it is about communism.

The problems and the overall mystery is usually pretty mild, the games are designed for children. There are also ""activity"" style games, that are usually dedicated to teaching children skills.

I've never played it, it came out 1988, for most computer options. From the Amiga, to the Apple II and Macintosh, MS-DOS, there was mostly a version available.

He was processing a goldfish at the time of the plot of the game. A terrorist group is trying to take over an aquatic city, and you are trying to stop them.

Tarleton Hoffman Bean was born in 1846 and died in 1916, and was a fish scientist. He famously was a friend of George Brown Goode, and they worked together as a duo on many things, often they are called ""The most successful duo in ichthyology"". I dunno, they probs did quite a bit, but they are no wonder twins. They wrote about 36 papers together, some are really cool. I think he more was the beneficiary of exploring waters that were poorly understood, so managed to learn a lot and name many species. His most famous works are about the fishes of Alaska and Washington. 
Tarleton Hoffman Bean held many positions of honor, working at some of the big museums of his time, including Fish Commission laboratory in Connecticut US, and the National Museum. He was the director of the New York Aquarium for a short time, but was likely fired (asked to resign) for not getting along with some of his higher ups. After working on some worlds fairs, he became New York‚Äôs state fish culturist, where he worked until he died in a car crash. (A fish culturist does not maintain fish arts and music; they are in charge of hatching fish.)
He's got some major weird quotes in some of his papers, my favorite being ""The territory of Alaska has 75 species of food-fishes, seven- eighths of which are strictly adapted to the use of man, the balance being more suitable for bait."" Huh? 75 species of fish in a state roughly the size of Western Europe? You're telling me that you can only find 75 fish there? Whatever. Also, ""strictly adapted?"" what does this mean? Milton Love, among my favorite authors goes off about this quote in his book. Here's his quote:
> ""What does ""strictly adapted"" to the use of man mean? Does it mean that these species are only adapted for man to use? What happens if a bear eats one? Will he go to Hell? What happens, if, say, a yellow eye rockfish doesn't want to be eaten by anyone? What if he just wants to hang out in his crevice eat the occasional sand lance, quietly engage in internal fertilization, and die at the age of 129 years? Will it go to Hell? And what about this ""strictly"" thing? Was Dr. Bean, out there in an igloo, into some sort of ichthyological bondage? Will he go to Hell? And is ichthyological bondage a good name for a scientific journal?""
He ends his discussion on that there. This is from Milton Love's __Certainly More Than You Want To Know About The Fishes of The Pacific Coast- A Postmodern Experience __ A fantastic book please read it. If you buy the book from him, he will sign it with a lipstick kiss if he can. 
Anyway, I brought up bean because the fish that are named after him have fun names. The naked darter, Ammocrypta beanii (Named by none other than David Starr Jordan for gods sake) Poecilopsetta beanii- the Deepwater Dab, and The Green Guapote- Mayaheros beani. Hah, Beani. Well I wanted an easy fact but here we are I guess. That turned into chaos.",

She researched sharks and Tetraodontiformes (puffers and the like). So much so that she earned the name ""The shark lady."" She was inspired by Aquariums and William Beebe to become a marine scientist, and fought to accomplish those dreams.
 She was rejected from graduate school at Columbia University due to sexism, and eventually ended up studying and getting a Masters and Ph.D. at New York University. She contributed some really cool research over time, and studies around the word. Her studies and book attracted the eyes of the wealthy Vanderbilt family, who paid for her to establish her own marine research station in Florida.
While at her station she worked with some of the biggest names of her time, especially Women Scientists. Sylvia Earle (not really a fish researcher, but a super important marine biologist) worked with her for a time. After moving the lab once, and going on many super interesting expiations she left the lab to take a professorship back near where she went to school in New York. That lab she founded eventually became Mote Marine Lab, one of the most important marine labs in the United States. She returned there after many years of teaching, and remained active in science until her death in 2015 at 92. Her last scuba dive was conducted in 2014 and some of her research was still being published after her death.

However, it is still used and was used frequently in the past. Wikipedia hosts a neat page listing famous ichthyologists, so I'ma talk about a couple. 
The list starts with Alexander Agassiz. If you've ever been in a biology course, it's likely that he came up at some point. He did a lot for classifying fish, sorting fish into different groups. He helped identify and categorize tons of different species (although many of these were later redone as they turned out to be wrong). His legacy unfortunately is overshadowed by his father, Louis Agassiz. Louis was a strong fighter of Darwin's theory of evolution, and a vocal proponent of Scientific Racism. He also contributed to fish quite a bit, but same story really with him, more just naming species. However, he also produced some of the most powerful evidence for evolution without knowing it, as he studied geology and distribution of fossils. It's believed he died still doubting his own data. 
I dunno, I might keep going with some more of these later on, but now I'm bummed out that so far we've talked about like 5 total fish scientists and they're all horrible racists.",

916418535423614987,2021-12-03 20:00:05.078000+00:00,"Alright, another fact I'm gonna have to tread lightly on, but it was requested so I'ma try. In the saltwater of the Atlantic coast there are two major types of saltwater catfish, the Hardhead catfish and the Gafftopsail Catfish. Both of these have various regional names, including tourist trout, seacat, and Gafftop. Found from basically Panama to Cape Cod, they are very common for people to find while fishing coastal waters. But, I'm not really hear to talk about them, I'm here to talk about their bones. 
So, they have a pretty normal skeleton for their group, including a sturdy spine, venomous spines in their fins, and a hard scull to protect their heads. When the catfish dies, the spines and the spine both degrade quickly, and the many small bones in the scull fall away, leaving really only the hard cap to the scull. As this fish is very common on the coast, these hard bits of bone wash up on beaches all the time. 
Well, beachcombers found these and took it as a sign of God, as you do. If you flip the scull over so the part of the head that would normally be inside of the head is facing towards you, it looks slightly like a crucifix, a symbol in Christianity depicting Jesus's crucifixion on a cross. I guess I can see it if I squint maybe, but this seems to me to be a pretty good case of pareidolia, the human ability to perceive meaningful images in essentially random or meaningless images. 
Nevertheless, humans have proceeded with much excitement around this. A fun poem was written by Conrad S. Lantz about it: 
> Of all the fish in the sea
> our Lord chose the lowly sailcat
> to remind us of His misery.
> His body on the cross is outlined,
> the hilt of the sword
> which was plunged into His side
> is clearly defined.
> 
> Look at the back of the fishes bone
> where the Roman shield is shown.
> When you shake the cross
> you will hear the dices being tossed
> for our Lord‚Äôs blood stained dress,
> those who hear them
> ‚Äîwill be blessed.
A fun poem, excluding that, in the versions I find, he uses in the second stanza ""fishes"" when he means ""fish's"".  Many others quote the bible Psalm 8 about it, here's verses 3 and 4 (KJV):
> When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;
> What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?
Just as a reminder, this is just a fish fact, I'm not trying to take a stance on the existence of any god(s) or in any god's provision of signs. Also sorry to anyone who read the rough draft of this one before I proofed it.",

Humans usually don't care much about bowfin, they don't make fantastic fishing apparently. They do fight strongly, but have sharp teeth that make them hard to handle once caught. The meat is poor if cooked normally, it gets squishy and gross. If smoked, apparently it is actually okay tasting.

Most, if not all of them have an organ called a labyrinth organ. They can gulp air and use air to respire rather than needing gills. This organ is important to them as many of them live in shallow, hot, small pools poor in oxygen. So they get their oxygen from the air! 
Some species are eaten in their range, though most are too small to bother with. Some of them are very beautiful, and are respected as aquarium fish. Most are fairly easy to keep as they breath air and can deal with some weird chemistry, although some are considered the hardest freshwater fish for a hobbyist to keep.

Humans intake water though our digestive system. We have all sorts of crazy tools to remove water from waste products and waste as little as possible. This makes sense, we are essentially fish that are desperately trying to stay wet in a very dry world. So we drink water by putting it into the internal systems we have to absorb and withhold water. Fish live in water, so there's no need to pump it into the internal systems. 
Most fish absorb water from their surroundings, seeing as they live in water. Their gills can pump water into and out of their bloodstream, allowing them to stay hydrated. So, not really drinking per se, but they are intaking water. 
A weird side effect of this is that fish live in really two different common water scenarios, salt water and fresh water (Many in-betweens and exceptions but I'm going to ignore it). Check out the osmosis fact for more, but freshwater fish are going to be trying to slow water from coming into their body, while saltwater fish are trying to pump water in. Water always moves from less salty to saltier, so the insides of a fish in freshwater are saltier than the water they live in, and a fish in saltwater is less salty than the water they live in. So, they have to keep balance in opposite ways. Again, check out the osmosis fact for more.",

913896317749690438,2021-11-26 20:57:41.524000+00:00,"Uhhhh I want to do a Black Friday fact because I thought that would be funny, but I couldn't find anything major, so let's talk about a good ol' fish fry. So a fish fry is a tradition of frying many fish to have a feast, usually with a group of people. Historically, this was done on Fridays, especially during Lent, as many Christians used to or still do abstain from most meat on Fridays during Lent  (fish being excluded as they are not warm-blooded) .  Lent is a time where Christians prepare for the celebration of Easter sorta, it's different in different traditions. Most often it begins on Ash Wednesday (don't really want to get into what that is) and ends right before Easter (the time when Christians celebrate the resurrection of Jesus).  
This tradition is especially strong in the United States, where Catholic, Lutheran, Anglican, and Methodist communities especially in the middle states use fish fries as social events. This tradition likely started during Lent has expanded to outside lent, where sometimes Fridays have become fish fry days even without having to abstain from other meats. 
As per the name, the fish is usually fried in oil. Most commonly in my experience, it is usually a freshwater species, catfish or tilapia, fried in oil or battered and then deep fried. Sometimes it has a ""potluck"" component, where attendees are expected to bring a dish to share. Apparently in coastal places they will use coastal fish such as cod, flatfish, or bream. I don't eat fish so the ones I've attended were overall pretty miserable affairs, but maybe someone enjoys them?",

Some people even eat fish for Thanksgiving. As for the Thanksgiving myth that may have happened, it's actually more likely to have featured fish than turkey, most likely shellfish. (Yea I know shellfish are not fish) 
I don't like the taste of fish but here's a roasted salmon recipe that the internet says is good for it: 

Ingredients
1 whole salmon ‚Äì Approximately 8 pounds, scaled and cleaned with the head and tail on (side note from me, try for farmed salmon maybe?)
4 leeks, trimmed of stems and halved lengthwise
4 oranges
1 red onion, cut into 1/8-inch slices
6 sprigs of fresh cilantro
1 cup of dry white wine
1 tablespoon of unsalted butter
1 teaspoon of salt
1/2 teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper
Directions
Pre-heat your oven to 400 degrees. Slice your leeks in half lengthwise and lay them on the bottom of a 12 x 18 jelly roll pan or half-sheet pan of a similar size.
Cut away the peel, pith (the white stuff under the peel), and outer membranes from two of your oranges, then slice them into 1/4-inch round slices.
Rinse salmon under cold water, clean out the cavity, and pat it dry with a paper towel. Cut 3 shallow slits through salmon‚Äôs skin, about 3 inches apart, on each side of fish. Season salmon cavity with salt and pepper.
Stuff the cavity with your fresh cilantro, sliced oranges, and sliced onion. Lay a piece of cheesecloth over the leeks in your pan, then lay the salmon on the cheesecloth. 
Juice the remaining two oranges into a small saucepan and boil over medium-high heat, then melt the butter into the juice. Brush the orange-butter mixture over the salmon, then place the pan into the preheated oven. 
Baste the salmon every 10 minutes with the orange-butter mixture until the skin is crispy and the meat is pink and firm ‚Äì about an hour. Use foil to cover the fish‚Äôs head or tail if they start getting too dark.
When the salmon is done, remove the pan from the oven and pour wine into the pan to loosen the salmon if it has stuck. This also helps deglaze the pan to get the best flavors. 
Lift the fish, using the cheesecloth, onto a serving platter. Discard the cheesecloth, and serve.",

913202738685431858,2021-11-24 23:01:39.389000+00:00,"I want to do another mention of the flatfishes, generally called an order, Pleuronectiformes. These are your Flounders, Soles, Halibuts, Turbots, Plaices, Dabs, and Brills. Generally they are fish that migrate their eyes from one side of their face to the other. If you wanna hear more about that check out the flatfish fact on 6/20/21.
So there were like a million names I listed there. You may wonder, what makes one fish a flounder, and the next a dab? Well, friend, I'll tell you. Nothing. No rhyme or reason at all it seems. Sometimes people like to say ""flounders eyes move to the right side while soles move to the left"" or something of the sort. Well that's not true. The Arrowtooth Flounder and the Petrale Sole are both right-eyed fish (oh god look where we are again the Petrale Sole's binomial name is Eopsetta jordani, named after, you guessed it, David Starr Jordan). 
A scientist in 1892 wrote ""The flounders and soles are abundant throughout the year. In general the name flounder is applied to most of the flatfish brought in except the best of the flounders which is called a sole. The confusion in names indicates how impossible it is to give an accurate account of the fish without scientific names."" 
And last but not least, a poem by one of my favorite fish authors, Milton Love. Titled: Soul Survivor: 
A sole sole on her soul did dwell,
""If I'm soul-less will I go to Hell?
  Thus conversly I wish
  To converse with an angelfish
I would then be in Heaven, truth to tell.""",

912856619073814528,2021-11-24 00:06:18.043000+00:00,"So if you add an apostorophy to ""why don(')t fish"" you get a few new results I'd like to talk about! 
""why don't fish bleed"" uhhh, they do! Fish have blood and if you cut into them, they will bleed. There are a few species that have blood without hemoglobin, so their blood is clear, but they will still bleed. Sometimes when a fish gets cut, it bleeds very little, and that is because they have less blood vessels at the surface than mammals do. We use our blood to help with heat and to make sure our very dry outer layers still get oxygen. Fish don't worry about heat, and they live in water so don't worry about drying out. So when you cut a fish lightly, often they won't bleed until you get fairly deep. Also, fish are often small and simply have less blood, so that could be an explanation. 
""why don't fish feel pain"" They do, and acting like they can't is sorta silly. Without an adverse reaction to negative situations, they would not live for long. See fish feeling pain fact. 
""why don't fish freeze in Antarctica"" ooooo Remember the antifreeze blood fish?! Give that a search. Some fish do some crazy stuff to prevent freezing in below freezing water, like fill their blood with antifreeze chemicals. Check out that fact! 
""why don't fish get electrocuted"" Hum... They do and can be electrocuted. I think something that people are thinking about is when lighting strikes the ocean, why does it not kill all the fish? Well, the ocean is a fairly good conductor, and a massive ground or earth. So, when lighting strikes the surface, it will rapidly spread across the surface, killing most things there (don't swim during lighting friends). But, any of the current that goes into the water is basically spread out so quickly that it's neutralized, causing little harm to fish. This is a bit different for freshwater, but I'm tired so I'ma leave it there.",

I don't like talking about him much because he's sorta the worst, but David Starr Jordan. His most famous contribution to ichthyology was Synopsis of Fishes of North America, a book he wrote in 1882, honestly not really the most exciting book. He was a prolific educator, and there are people even still today who take pride in the fact that the person who taught the person who taught them was taught by David Starr Jordan. 
Unfortunately, along with actual science, he also taught quite a bit about eugenics. So that's neat. He wrote many papers with titles like ""On Behalf of Racial Purity"" And ""The Blood of A Nation"" that are disgusting. He expressed many fears about what he called ""race degeneration."" Honestly real gross. Even worse, he taught these beliefs to college and high school students. He even had a hand in publishing the horrifyingly titled ""Sterilization for Human Betterment"" it contains even more horrors than the title lets on.
He also may have had a hand in the coverup of a murder, although it's sorta iffy. Jane Stanford (Yea, Stanford university Stanford) died on vacation to Hawaii, and the first person who looked at her body said she died of poisoning and that her death was a murder. Jordan himself went to Hawaii and hired a doctor who then said that she died of a heart condition.  He was president of Stanford at the time of her death, but was essentially fired from that position in 1916. It's generally accepted nowadays that she WAS murdered, but it's unknown why Jordan would have covered for the murder. 
He's done some other good things in his life, including helping teachers unions, leading the Sierra Club for a while. Most important to me, he was an early fighter of pseudoscience and unfounded claims, which was extremely needed in his time. Maybe more needed now. Anyway, that's quite enough about famous racist David Starr Jordan.",

""why dont fish drown"" Fish have gills! The gills on a fish take the oxygen naturally dissolved in the water and use that to respire. It's like what we do on land, except rather than using air, mostly nitrogen with some oxygen, they use water, mostly water, just a tiny amount of oxygen. I've done like 5 fish facts on this one alone, check out the one about breaking the molecule of water (fish don't do that).
""why dont fish sleep"" Well, we don't know that they don't, in fact there's some evidence that they do. Just keep in mind that their brains are wayyyy different even in shape from ours, so the needs of their brains are not the same as the needs of ours.
""why dont fish sink"" It's complicated! Most frequently it‚Äôs because they have a swim bladder, a pocket of gas that they use to regulate their density to move up and down in the water. Some fish, like sharks use oils in their livers to do this. Some fish, on the other hand, DO sink. They lack either of those two adaptations, and live on the bottom. No need to float if you want to sink. For a cute example of a swim bladderless fish, check out my Orangethroated Darter fact! 
""why dont fish blink"" Well, most fish don't have eyelids, so they literally cannot. If you think about it, the main reason we blink is to keep our eyes moist. When you live in water, keeping moist isn't an issue. Some fish have something like an eyelid that serves the other purpose of an eyelid, protecting the eye. Some sharks have this, so their prey doesn't damage their eye as they are eating them. So some fish DO blink!",

911046400568074270,2021-11-19 00:13:08.319000+00:00,"""can fish see in the dark"" Sorta! Fish vision is usually better than ours for most species that live in places where water is easy to see in. However, fish are masters at using other senses to ""see."" Electrosensory organs, the lateral line, and smell/taste are all really good examples of this. Check out the fish senses facts! 
""can fish see water"" So I can't ask a fish, but I imagine the response is no, not really. Just like humans cannot ""see"" the air they look though, I would imagine fish cannot see the water they look though. I would guess that they can see the border between water and air though. 
""can fish smell"" Yea, usually. They have a developed chemosensory sense They do not, however, likely differentiate between a sense of smell and a sense of taste. 
""can fish see air"" I dunno! Probably, just like we can see the boarder between air and water, I would imagine they can see it. Their vision is adapted for being underwater though, and likely does not (for most species) work well when taken out of water. 
""can fish see color"" Yea, probably. Most fish have light sensing cells much like that of humans so they likely see about what we do. However, there are exceptions. 
""can fish drown in water"" I'm gonna just say yes on this one, if you want all the background and waffling about terminology, see previous fish fact. 
""can fish eat bread"" Yea probably, but they shouldn't. Most fish can ""eat"" basically anything that gets into their mouth. However, most fish are also adapted to eat things that they naturally find in their habitat. Bread is not natural, it's almost exclusively human made. Please don't feed wild fish bread.",

""can fish drown"" I mean, sorta. If you take oxygen out of water, a fish is, in a way going to drown. They need the Oxygen that is dissolved in water to survive. But, no, they aren't drowning in the same way a human does. We drown by flooding our lungs with water, they simply don't have lungs. Fish basically die as their body runs out of oxygen. Humans can have all sorts of lung garbage go on before they run out of Oxygen. 
""can fish feel pain"" Yes next question. Okay seriously, who thought that for some reason because it live in water pain is impossible? It's likely that pain is different to them, but it still incurs problems. I did a fact on this before. I've never read that book though, maybe I'll try and find it! 
""can fish hear"" Yes! More or less. Fish are diverse and some are better than others at hearing. They often sense sound differently than we do though, so I don't know if hearing is what I'd call it... Maybe just sound sensing? Check out the fact on lateral lines for more info on that one.",

""Are fish sticks healthy."" This isn't really my realm of knowledge, but it seems like the majority of folk who know say no. Fish sticks often contain a lot of breading and are fried in oil, giving them some heavy doses of trans-fats. As always with diet, in moderation they could be fine though.
""Are fish omnivores"" Yea, some are. Not all for sure though. Some fish do eat plants and animals, in fact, some sharks even do! Check out the bonnethead fact. 
""Are fish herbivores"" Humm... This is a bit tougher, as I don't really think that a pure herbivore exists, most fish will usually eat meat if it happens to be easy or is harder to remove otherwise. Herbivores like Tangs will eat meat if it comes to them.. So yea, there are Herbivores, but not perfect herbivores. Who is perfect though, anyway?

I‚Äôm gonna try and respond to some google autocomplete questions. I'm gonna make some choices on what I want to write for some of these, so don't expect like 100 questions a fact, I may just do one. 
Let‚Äôs go! I'm gonna start with ""are fish.""
""Are fish animals"" yes! There are many ways to define animal, but fish fall correctly into the animal group every time. In 2015 the ""7 kingdoms"" of life were stated (please don't yell at me if you know the controversy behind the 7 kingdoms I know) and they are Bacteria, Archaea, Protozoa, Cromista, Plantae Fungi and Animalia. All fish by our definition are in Animalia.
""Are fish cold-blooded"" Uhhh it's complicated. Depends on what you call cold blooded, and depends on how many exceptions you're willing to make. See past fish fact about cold-bloodedness. 
""Are fish mammals"" No! That one is easy. An argument could be made to say that Mammals are fish, but not the other way around. Mammals have hair or fur, are warm-blooded, most are born alive, and the young are fed milk produced by the mother's mammary glands. Fish by definition fail almost all of those. 
""Are fish reptiles"" No again! An argument could be made that reptiles are fish, but not the other way around. Reptiles‚Äô bodies are completely covered with scales, are cold-blooded, produce shelled eggs or bear live young, fertilize eggs internally, and all species of reptiles have at least one lung. Fish fail most of these, although some they could pass if you squint. 
""Are fish Vertebrates"" Yes! By our definition they are. See the fish defining fact. 
""Are fish warm-blooded‚Äù I mean, not usually. Sometimes but not usually. See fish fact about warm bloodedness.",

So rockfish in the past were mostly longline fished, they will bite basically anything that sparkles, making things like shiny pieces of metal attached to hooks a good thing to catch them with. Some people claim that they can be caught on only a hook. However, as per what most humans do, fishing for them degraded to just netting them using huge nets scraping on the bottom. This of course crashed the fishery and it is still struggling to recover. Many of the fish that are caught are very old, some live over 100 years. At times, rockfish were discarded in favor of other species, basically throwing away 100-year-old fish, dead. A bit sad. There's a story of lines of fish miles dead behind some fishing boats.  Assuming a fish every about 50 feet that would be like 1000s of years of fish dead behind boats. 
Generally, the lighter colored fish, especially the red and yellow colored fish would fetch higher prices, and would usually all be called ""reds"" while the darker colored fish would be called ""Junk."" There is no difference between the two shades of fish in taste. There are even some stories stating that darker colored fish were more ""preferred"" buy some cooks. This was usually blatant racism, I.E. ""Grass rockfish are a favorite of Jewish cooks."" A direct quote from ""How to fish the pacific coast.""",

So, rockfish oddly are usually considered a member of the order Scorpaeniformes, a bit less common that your everyday perciforms, one of the main groups of fish we look at. Red snappers are members of the Perciforms, so it's interesting that they can be passed off as one another. They sit in Scorpaeniformes with the rest of the scorpionfish. 
The name Sebastes means magnificent, and refers to their brilliant colors. Unfortunately, they are speciating and diversifying at an alarming rate. Well alarming for scientists, they're struggling to keep up. New species are found often, usually by seeing differences in small traits. Unfortunately for scientists, once they notice this that means that any research, they've done on a group of individuals thinking that they were the same species then has to be parsed as to whether it was from one species or the other. 
If you've ever been fishing for rockfish, you have probably seen one with a weird black growth on them. These are common in the whole group. They are officially called hyperplastic and neoplastic lesions, and they are weird melanophores that seem to have gone wrong for some reason. We don't know what causes them, or if it hurts the fish. We do know that fish with these lesions are still safe to eat.",

Here in the US, the main fishes called rockfish are in the Genus Sebastes. This is a HUGE group. Mostly in the Pacific with only a few representatives from other oceans, the most species are in the northern parts of the pacific, On the US side from Northern California to Alaska,  including British Columbia. On the other side from about Japan North to Alaska. They mostly eat meat, feasting upon the coastal upwelling's bounty. 
Near the shores in the Pacific you get coastal upwelling, where cold, deep, nutrient rich water gets pushed up to the surface. This makes the coastal areas in the North Pacific really cool, and leads to lots of animals living just off of the coast. The genus of rockfish we're looking at covers 109 species alone, most of which are found there! Diets usually consist of smaller fish and inverts.
They are eaten by humans, and are commonly fished. Some of them overfished, leading to protections. Oddly, some species look like the much more expensive Red Snapper, and have been fraudulently passed off as such.",

They feed mostly on inverts that live on the bottom, mostly in the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic oceans. 
The name tilefish seems to be rooted in a long explanation involving the name Tilus, so don't worry too much about that. Do worry about eating them though! These guys have a TON of mercury in them.

To breathe, fish need to be able to pull water into their mouth, then close the mouth. After that they need to push the water out of the gills. To do that, they (sometimes) actually expand the volume of the mouth by moving the bones surrounding the mouth. This pulls water into the mouth. They then push it back out by reversing the process. I've seen scientists quote that fish have on average 130 bones in their head, but that feels a bit large of a number seeing as humans have a total usually quoted at 206. I'd believe it though if you included fossil fish, some of those guys have tons of bones seemingly randomly assorted. I saw one that had 156 bones. 
Fish also need to catch prey, too. Some fish can expand the volume of their mouths crazy fast, acting like a vacuum. I could have sworn I did a fact on the slingjaw wrasse, but I can't find it! I guess I'll do a separate fact for that one.",

||So, back in roman times there was a roman statesman named Vedius Pollio, who was an authority in some way over the province of Asia in Rome (history does not seem to be super clear). The historians do not talk much about his statesmanship though, they more reference his cruelty and luxury. According to a few historians, he had a massive estate with an odd pool, in which he kept lampreys. 
Lampreys are parasitic, I think there's a fish fact about them. They prefer to eat other fish, but will eat anything that bleeds if they are hungry enough. I think you may see where this is going. Pollio kept many slaves, and when they would simply make mistakes he would throw them into this pool, allowing the fish to essentially eat them. They would not survive this process.  
The story goes that Augustus (yea that one) was eating at Pollio's estate when a slave dropped a crystal cup. Pollio immediately condemned him to be fed to the lampreys.  The slave then broke down and begged Augustus to be killed in any other manner. The emperor immediately ordered all of Pollio's expensive glasses smashed in front of Pollio. The emperor filled in the lamprey pool. The tellings of the story differ, but he may have also freed the slave that begged for mercy. 
This story is actually very common among Roman-times historians. Many of these historians did not like Pollio, so the portrayal of him is not good. These stories may be embellished, or even fictional. but it's a fun story!||",

Let's talk hammerheads! So I brought up the bonnethead without blinking, which may have been a bit rude. Let's talk about them! 
Usually, hammerheads are considered a family, marked frequently by their obvious elongated heads, called a cephalofoil. Almost all species are coastal and feed off of a diet of meat, often a mixture of fish and crustaceans. Stingrays seem to be an overall favorite for most species. The largest species, the great hammerhead, can grow to around 6 m (20ish feet). The smallest is less than a meter (2ish feet). 
That head likely has many uses and people still argue about it. Some things are for sure though. We know that the head gives the shark fantastic vision, it can see nearly 360 degrees around its body, allowing it to track food very well. Having the eyes separated like that also gives the shark good binocular vision leading to increased depth perception (probably). There are other uses too, though the claims may be more dubious. The shape of the head may allow the shark to have more sensory organs leading to better prey detection. The shape of the head may help the shark dodge stings from their favorite food, stingrays. The shape of the head may also help the ray move, giving them more control over the way they move through the water. All of those claims are likely correct and the head likely serves many purposes. 
Most species are endangered or critically endangered. Only one species is listed as only vulnerable. There is one species yet to be assessed as well.

They are named after their rather rounded head, that sorta looks like the of a bonnet. They are common essentially worldwide, mostly in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, mostly coastally. 
Their diet is mostly crabs, shrimp, and sometimes mollusks. Oddly, they seem to be the only species of shark that is omnivorous, with seagrass taking up to 65% of their diet in some individuals! That makes them the only shark that is known to eat and actually absorb nutrients from plants. 
Sadly, this species has been declining across most of its range, mostly due to human fishing activity. They were listed as least concern until 2020, when declining populations caused them to be lifted to endangered status.",

It made me realize that it might not be super clear. Fish, at least as far as I know, require oxygen to survive, much like we do. We get our oxygen from the air, which is a mixture of different gases. The atmosphere of the earth is mostly nitrogen, with about 21% oxygen. We breath in this mixture, and pick the oxygen out of the air inside of our lungs. Makes sense. 
So water has the chemical formula H‚ÇÇO, two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. The science teacher thought that the oxygen fish needed was from the oxygen in the actual molecule of water. Nope nope nope nope. Fish do NOT break those bonds for oxygen generation. In fact, quite the opposite happens. 
Breaking water into its parts is possible. The process commonly used is called Electrolysis, it involved running electrical current through the water to essentially rip the bond apart. This would leave you with hydrogen on one side, and oxygen on the other. This takes quite a bit of energy. There are a few other ways, including biological ways. Plants break down water as part of photosynthesis. Fish do NOT derive the oxygen they need to survive in this way. 
The oxygen they use is Oxygen that is already diffused into the water. Oxygen is literally mixed into the water, almost like it is in air, just in a much weaker concentration. Fish are just pulling the oxygen they need to survive out of the water, they are not generating their own oxygen from water.
The equation for respiration in animals in it's VERY MOST simple form is sugar+oxygen‚Üíwater+carbon dioxide+ATP. ATP is essentially the energy carrier.  Therefore the lady was almost exactly wrong, fish create water, not break it down (at least in this case).",

For many years it has been on the endangered species list. The fish originally declined due to damming of the river and introduction of species that compete/eat them. 
The US Fish and Wildlife Service says that the species has recovered and his doing okay. Many, if not most other groups say that that is untrue. Most groups are citing the critical water shortage in the Colorado River Basin and increased human factors on the river. The international organization that most nations look to for conservation, the IUCN, still has the species listed as endangered. Not only that, but the IUCN states that the population is still in decline, nearing critical endangerment. 
Most of the protections for the fish remain in place, but some fear that the removal of this species is an attempt to begin more human interference in the already overburdened Colorado River. I personally suspect (This is a conspiracy theory so don't trust me too much) that it is a move in anticipation of needing to take drastic measures to assist with the severe drought and keep water supplied to the 7 US states that depend on it, including some of the largest population centers in the US.

They are a freshwater species, (used to be a few species,) that lives in rivers. The American Paddlefish is the only remaining species. It lives in the Mississippi River and its larger tributaries. 
They are filter feeders! Rare in freshwater ecosystems, they really are the only large swimming filter feeder I can think of. When I say large, I mean large too, average of 1.5 m (4.9 ft) (The largest caught 7 ft 1 in (2.16 m) long). 
Unfortunately, things are not looking so good for them. They need huge rivers to do well, with no dams or locks on them. All of the large sections of the Mississippi river now have some sort of thing on them, which messes up their range. They are declining across much of their range, and are now listed as vulnerable. Humans eat them too! The eggs are eaten much like Sturgeon Caviar. 
The Chinese paddlefish likely suffered the same fate were seeing the American species suffer now. There have only been 2 sightings of the species only found in the Yangzi and the Yellow Rivers since 2000. They were declared extinct in 2019. They were likely done in by the damming of these massive rivers, changing their steady river habitat into something they were not adapted to.",

This allows for a special lifestyle for these fish. They live in floodplains or vernal pools, places that are often dry, but sometimes are flooded with lots of water. During the wet times, the eggs hatch and quickly breed. The lifespan of the fish is very short, and they lay eggs and die fast. The pools dry out, and then the eggs go dormant waiting for the next time the area is underwater. This allows them to take over a habitat that is full of food, and not so full of predators.",

The way he tested it is a bit jank. He basically stuck some living fish into a blender and blended them up. Plenty enough physical damage and stress to create any sort of warning chemical. He would then drip some of this mixture into the habitat of a living fish and they would respond with panic. 
Turns out, he's right! There are chemicals that serve this purpose, though people still don't understand exactly why.  It likely helps fish that share genes with you survive. It also may attract other predators that would be less likely to prey on you then prey on what's trying to eat you. It also plays a role in sunburn protection and immune response, so it may have already been a thing in response to trauma that fish just evolved to be afraid of.",

Just like you've been told you can figure the age of a tree, you can count the rings in an otolith to figure the age of a fish! 
Usually, otoliths are sawed open and then brought to a microscope where they are examined and the rings are counted. This usually gives a fairly accurate estimate of age, although there are many things that could cause faults in this method. Things like malnutrition, odd seasons, or simply being too small to collect an otolith can cause a lot of confusion among people looking for ages. 
This is super important to fisheries science, as the age of fish caught can tell you the health of the population. If you have ended up fishing only young or only old fish, you've likely got a problem.",

Oto- means ear, -Lith stone. These are ear stones!! These allow animals, especially fish, to detect acceleration (in the most general meaning of acceleration). 
The otolith itself basically works by being a sack of liquid or gel that you drop the rock into. If you accelerate that sack, the rock on the inside accelerates slower due to inertia. The slow acceleration causes the otolith to touch the sides of the sack. It also helps tell a fish which way is up, as the stone will follow gravity. This is a very basic description so please don't be mad. 
Neat huh?! I think I'll save some more otolith stuff for later.",

Remoras are a species of fish that is adapted to attach itself to other animals, mostly other large fish. The situation may be mutualism, with the remora cleaning the animal and removing parasites, but is more likely commensalism, where the remora benefits but the animal they stick onto does not. (see Biologicals Relationship fish fact!) 
These guys use a modified fin on the top of their head that they can use to create suction, and then they can slide back to lock on to the animal. They are good swimmers on their own, and can usually keep up with the fish they attach to if they want to.
There's lots of human interaction with remoras. The most interesting one to me is the use of them while fishing for turtles. A cord would be attached to the tail of the remora, and then it would be released near the turtle. They could then pull both the remora and the turtle it attached itself to. The reports of this come mostly from the Indian ocean, and is not practiced nowadays as far as I can tell. Remoras in ancient Greece and Later Rome were thought to stop ships, in fact the word Remora means delay.",

894714971571753000,2021-10-04 22:37:52.223000+00:00,"Okay, triggerfish. Here we go. Triggerfish are found around the globe in tropical and subtropical areas. They are mostly carnivores, eating anything living they can catch. Their diet consists mostly of inverts, things like crabs, clams, and worms. They are slow swimmers so would like to catch fish but are usually outmatched if the fish tries to escape. 
They are Tetradontoforms, so they are related to puffers and the Mola, and keep the same scary teeth. Those teeth are helpful in biting and crunching things with hard shells. They are one of those fish that doesn't usually use its caudal fin to swim, choosing instead to undulate the anal and dorsal fins. 
The name triggerfish comes from their ability to raise and lower their spines! The first two spines on their backs are able to be raised and lowered at will, and are usually used in defense. The spines have a really cool setup where they get locked in the up position by surrounding bones. Most fish you can brush spines like that back, but triggers you cannot, they're locked in place. The rear spine locks the front one, so if you press the rear spine, you can push the front one down. So, the smaller 2nd spine is the ""trigger"" and therefore they are called triggerfish. 
Some are edible, but many contain ciguatoxin and should not be eaten (Check up on the ciguatoxin fact!). Many species depend on vanishing reef ecosystems and may become more and more endangered as time goes on. Keep reef habitats safe, and watch what fish you eat to help them!",

Usually, 5 cards are dealt to every player and the remainder are placed in the center where all players can reach them. Often this is in a random pile, and is called the pond or ocean. Players take turns asking other players phrases like ""Do you have any queens?"" If the asked player has a queen, they must give them to the asking player. If not, they reply ""Go Fish."" When told to ""Go fish"" the asking player reaches into the pile and takes a card. Once you have all 4 suits (in a standard deck Hearts, Spades, Clubs, and Diamonds) with the same face value, you have a set and remove all 4 from your hand. The player who has the largest number of cards taken out of play at the end wins.

Greenland sharks are huge, the larger estimates are 7.3 m (24 ft) and more than 1,400 kg (3,100 lb). Massive animals. Their diet is mostly fish, but they have been observed hunting seals before. They are slow sharks, so rely on sneaking up on their prey, often while their prey is inactive, like at night. While they are usually hunters, they never turn a meal down and will eat basically any meat that falls into the water. They have been found with everything from various types of deer in their stomach to chunks of polar bear. 
Greenland sharks almost never attack people, mostly because they only inhabit water that is too cold for most people to go into. The sharks are often blinded by a parasite, see the parasite fact for more about that. Humans do eat these sharks, but the flesh is poison fresh or cooked. To consume it it must first be dried and fermented. In Iceland it's called k√¶stur h√°karl and is buried in the ground for months before it is consumed to allow it to ferment. They are not a really good species to eat, and I don't recommend it for taste, health, and conservation reasons. 
The reason why I'm bringing them up now is because they are the worlds longest-lived vertebrate! Some are estimated to be over 350 years old. The usual estimate given is 392 plus or minus 120 years.",

Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (i.e., F.I.S.H.)! So, there's a lot to go over here- so let‚Äôs start with the words used in FISH. Fluorescence is when a chemical emits or reflects light when exposed to something- common in biology. The phrase In Situ means where you find it, in the original place. Hybridization refers in this sense to the binding of florescent molecules only to certain biologically active molecules. Uhh... So it's when you add glowy chemicals into cells to make certain parts glow different colors. 
This may at first sound pretty, but useless. But FISH has led to some huge leaps in biology and genetics. So, picture this. You want to figure out where in a genome (a genome is the WHOLE DNA sequence of species, in humans its 3.2 billion letters long) a sequence exists. You know that somewhere, the DNA has a certain code, but you don't know where. So, you make up or find some DNA that has the code you want to find. You add some markers onto your chunk of DNA. You take a cell and break apart its DNA, and squirt in the marked DNA you made. The marked DNA binds with the whole sequence of DNA where it can, where the gene would naturally be in the Genome. You then attach glowy colors onto the markers you added, and look closely for the glow! Where the glow shows up is where your gene is located! I know that sounds like gibberish, I recommend taking a look at some of the diagrams I'll post. 
This was and is used often in science. It now can be used to define where and when genes are expressed, as not all genes are ""on"" all the time. Back in the day before genomes were completely sequenced it could mark where on a genome something was. It has too many medical implications to even discuss, I recommend reading the wiki page if you want a headache/want to know more. FISH was made possible (in a roundabout way) by the Nobel prize winning discovery of Green Florescent Proteins (GFPs). It was a Protein first discovered in a Jelly, which honestly has been pivotal in many parts of science. (Remember glo-fish? That's GFP too!) One of my favorite Nobel Prizes.",

Whales and dolphins make ""bubble nets, blowing bubbles in a circle around the fish, and then diving up through the main group as they are trapped within the bubbles.

But fish do respond to electricity, generally fish will align themselves with electric fields, swimming from the cathode to the anode. The movement is uncontrolled, they cannot help it. The electricity will stun them and make them easy to capture. It only works in freshwater though, as saltwater is too conductive and disperses charge too fast. 
It's used nowadays mostly by scientists. It is really good at counting all the individuals in an area, as there's no way to escape it. In most places in Europe and America it is extremely illegal for people to do it for commercial or personal use. If used by recreational fishermen it can kill species off really fast. 
Some of the machines are crazy! Usually, it's a generator that produces the electricity in a backpack. I've seen some home-made (illegal) tools taken by the US Department of Fish and Wildlife that are insane though, some that are hand cranked, some that connect directly to power sockets or even just to power lines.

Goldfish are, after all, just modified carp. Carp are opportunistic, and will eat basically anything they can get. Goldfish, like many other fish, will never stop eating on their own accord if they have the opportunity, making them pretty dangerous in ecosystems like the freshwater lakes of North America. They even revert slowly back to their original less golden coloration. 
This trend actually features across almost all of the Asian Carp species. The bighead carp, black carp, grass carp, and silver carp are all introduced from Asia, and all problem causers. Many of these species can alter whole ecosystems, changing the entire food web. Grass carp are famous herbivores, and will tear up plants and algae underwater, stripping whole areas bare, changing the whole habitat. 
A reminder I've said before, NEVER release animals who are in human care back into the wild, dead or alive. If you have a live fish you cannot care for, talk to a local pet shop, if they can't help you, they can usually direct you to a local group or forum that can. A fish, living or dead, should never end up in the toilet, there's too much of a risk of that animal changing natural ecosystems. If you fish has died, wrap it in a paper towel, seal in a plastic bag, and dispose with food waste, preferably though a centralized waste disposal system (though I'm well aware these aren't available to everyone).",

In humans, the digestive system is pretty boring. So the mouth breaks down most food and adds some different things in your saliva to start digestion. Food goes to your stomach where acid is introduced to break it down further, and muscly walls smash and squish the food around. It then moves into the small intestine, where most of the absorbing happens. The small intestine is a long tube that worms its way around in your midsection, allowing lots of space to get out everything you can out of your food. Then it goes to the large intestine, mostly for water absorption/reabsorption, and when that is done you poop what's left out. The digestive system takes up a ton of space inside of you. (Please people who know about human digestion be nice I'm trying to keep it simple) 
Sharks save a lot of space on that. They have a stomach, but their intestines are crazy! rather than going with a super wormy tube, they have one tube, with a spiral wall that runs down it. That means that food has to go all the way down the spiral, being absorbed the whole time! They save a lot of space that way. They also can eat less frequently, as food takes a long time to digest and they get a ton of nutrients out of every meal!",

Less common is the ""Look I'm an everyman because I fish, look at how normal I am."" 
The tough guy image is easy to find in history. For the US, Roosevelt is the most obvious example. Famously he loved to fish, caching everything from manta rays in in the ocean off of Florida to tarpons off the Gulf Coast. He used his ""sportsmanship"" to cultivate his already formed rough rider image. For a more modern example I turn to Vladimir Putin, who often is seen in photos in the wild, catching and killing all manner of animal, fish as no exception. 
The best American example of a ""fishing makes me seem down to earth"" sort of thing is Jimmy Carter. He would refer to it as his ""relaxation time."" and would sometimes spend up to 12 hours fishing. 
Oddly, I can find little information about other world leaders who fished. I know there's some Australian PMs who fished, including famous disappearance Harold Holt. Much of the information on Holt is hard to find beyond his disappearance though. Anybody else know a world leader that likes to fish?",

It's true that Bull sharks intrude into freshwater. They are salt water tolerant, and use salt water for lots of purposes. Freshwater or brackish water is used sometimes by younger sharks to keep safe. As the sharks grow older, they get better adapted to extremely salty or fresh water. There is evidence of them moving way up in the Mississippi River, as high as Illinois, USA! Bull sharks are also known as a common shark in shark attacks, and have attacked people in freshwater as well, reportedly. 
However, they are not the only species of shark that inhabits freshwater. There are quite a few species of shark that go into freshwater. Better known among them are the sawfishes, and the sandbar shark. Most of these won't go into full freshwater, but will get pretty darn close. However, the most stunning example of freshwater sharks are the Asian and Australian freshwater sharks. 
Little is known about these guys. They inhabit muddy, dark water at the openings of rivers, and even up into the river. These guys are super cool, but poorly understood. Very little is known about them, and they seem to be vanishing fast. The Ganges River shark is likely the best known, but happens to only live in one of the most endangered rivers in the world. The Ganges suffers from extreme pollution (this is argued by some people, but is unfortunately true.), and this likely has hurt the shark. It is now very rare to see, the last sighting I can find is from 2018. There are many other species of freshwater shark in the same group, and they often face the same fate. Their habitat, being so close to humans is super at-risk.",

You bring something up to a very high temperature, killing most bacteria. You then seal it while it is still at that high temperature, preventing any new bacteria from getting in. This stops decay and provides a method of moving food without needing refrigeration. This was discovered in 1795, by Nicolas Appert. 
The reason why I mention the date of discovery, is because it predates germ theory! It would be another 50 years before Louis Pasteur discovered what role microbes play in food spoilage. By 1830 canning was used in Europe for fish, by 1840 in America, first the East Coast, then West. See past fact for more. 
Sardines are probably the most famous canned fish, see past fact about them. They played a huge role in the development of industry in the Western United States. The famous ""Cannery Row"" in Monterrey, California was originally a sardine canning area- it's now a tourist area. 
Tuna is also canned, but not whole fish. Tuna is shredded and added to water, oil, or sauces and sealed. Most of the tuna actually goes to the production of cat or dog food, with very little going towards human consumption. Almost all canned tuna in the US is eaten in sandwiches or salads.",

Salmon Canning actually pioneered the canning of fish, mostly starting in the Pacific Northwest. Back in the day, the way of preserving fish was to salt them. Leaving fish in tons of salt dehydrates and sanitizes them, making it less likely to break down. As you could guess, that changes the flavor and texture significantly. A group of 3 people built a boat, and using methods known for a long time began canning salmon on the Sacramento River in California, USA. They then moved their barge/factory to the Columbia River in Oregon/Washington, USA, and became a big deal. The first cannery was built in 1864, by 1883 there were 39 canneries on the Columbia River alone. In 1867 the first cannery was established in Canada on the Fraser River, British Columbia. 
These canneries were mostly manned by migrant workers (mostly Chinese and Japanese), First Peoples, and Native Americans. Oftentimes this was for horrid wages and really bad working conditions. When machines began to take over for jobs humans used to do, they were named racist names associated with the workers they replaced. Surprisingly, canneries were a place where women were often seen working, although race played a huge part in that. 
Canned fish took a big hit with the invention of refrigeration, which can keep fish fresh for days. However, canned fish lasted well into modern times and are still produced in some places. The last big cannery on the Columbia closed in 1980. All together with factories from California, though Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, Alaska, Northern Russia, and Japan they peaked at 300,000 tonnes a year. This obviously hurt fish populations that have never truly recovered and now are supported by hatcheries.",

So this can be interpreted in many ways, and one is an assault on the culture or traditions of a particular people, country, or race. That is not my intention and should not be interpreted as such. I am trying to represent something that actually happens as fact. I will try to be honest, and at least represent things fairly, but I do have my own opinions and will not try and hide them. 
Okay, so throughout culture humans have sought to cure and treat various illnesses with basically everything, from just literal food to literal poison, with varying degrees of success. The way this effects fish is usually with dried fish and fish parts used to treat various illnesses. 
Dried fish are used in traditional medicines all across the world, unfortunately there is one area of the world where it is most common, mostly Asia. China, Taiwan, and parts of Southeast Asia all are famous for this. 
The WHO (World Health Organization) notes that traditional medicines are extremely important to many people in treating illness. They also note that many situations some of these medicines have actual active ingredients that are not integrated into the dominate health care system. However, they also note that some of these medicines are dangerous, causing active harm. They also note that many of these products are not produced in a safe manner. The WHO in my opinion, is extremely forgiving of traditional medicine. 
Many studies have found that there are all sorts of problematic effects of these medicines. A few of them cause active harm, many do nothing at all. They do play an active role in producing the placebo effect which is an important part of medicine, so should not be discounted. I also cannot deny that traditional medicine is a powerful tool for discovering active ingredients and chemicals that can save lives.  Tu Youyou is a noble prize winning chemist that found many of her treatments for illness using Chinese medicine. 
However, these treatments hurt fish populations. Seahorses, whale sharks, and many other endangered fishes are hunted exclusively for medicines that often have no basis in science. Seahorses have been hunted and populations have been destroyed simply because their dried bodies are used as a treatment for ""infertility"" and other things. These endangered animals are hunted to be an expensive Viagra. 
I personally think that while traditional medicine is an important part of culture, like everything, it MUST be undertaken with the protection of our world first. We cannot use it as an excuse to over-harvest species, cruelly keep species, or destroy ecosystems.",

Famously, they attract their prey using a lure that they hold just in front of their mouth, it's a modified part of their dorsal fin. The lure has some bioluminescence to it, attracting some of the animals they like to eat just within striking distance. 
The name footballfish probably comes from its similarity in appearance to a football. I can't tell if it's American or everywhereelsean football. BUT, happy start of the American Football season!",

The Portuguese man o' war is a bit of a complicated topic, it's a jelly-like creature that floats at the surface using a large blue float. Hanging down into the water, the animal has tentacles sometimes reaching up to 30 m (100 ft). They are fish eaters, catching fish to eat with a strong venomous sting. So, they would be the last place you would think to find a live fish. But swimming around the tentacles you'll find the Man-of-war fish, dodging among the tentacles feeding on the shorter, smaller ones not used for prey capture. This means that the fishes habitat provides shelter, food, and space; no other fish would dare try and eat something among the deadly stings. 
For a long time, it was thought that they were immune to the sting, but it turns out they are not. Instead of being immune, they actually just dodge getting stung by the tentacles. The fish does have a complex skin structure and at least one antigen to the venom, but not enough to protect them from the worst stings.",

They have crazy large gill cavities that when threatened they fill with water! This enables them to blow up like a pufferfish, protecting them from being eaten.

They can therefore take over habitats really quickly. 
Humans have taken advantage of the quick breeding to breed them into millions of patterns, colors, and looks. If you've ever kept them, you know how fast just a few guppies turns into millions. They mostly eat small zooplankton in rivers, but won't turn away tiny fish or even insects.

Most frequently they are eaten raw or dried after this process. This usually, as expected, smells very bad. Fish sauce may deserve its own fact, but is produced in this manner.
Europe has messed with this as well, Garum is an ancient sauce/seasoning that is made of long fermented fish. Lakerda is a Greek concoction made of fish weighted and left with salt for about a week.

The Orangethroat Darter is a small fish that hangs out in the riffles of streams. Riffles are the parts of the stream or creek where the water becomes fast moving and flows over rocks before pooling and slowing again. They inhabit smaller freshwater rivers and streams from Michigan all the way down to Texas, covering almost all of the central USA. Most of their diet consists of aquatic insects or crustaceans that have gotten knocked off of rocks by the current. The males are brilliant blues reds and oranges while the females are duller brown, during mating season both individuals become much more colorful. 
I remember times during my childhood where I would splash around in streams with a net and scoop up tons of little darters- rarely any other species besides these. The brilliant colors were stunning in the spring on the males, making them look very foreign in the brown Midwestern streams. The species actually is a sign of a healthy stream system, upon pollution they will vanish quickly, making them a good mark of a healthy ecosystem.

It's a bit against what people would normally think, as usually, things dissolve faster as the temperature increases. So that means that it is usually easier to be a fish in colder water than it is in warmer water. Fish require oxygen to survive- so colder is usually easier than hotter.
However, some fish can get around that. Remember the pupfish?! They're back! Some pupfish can tolerate long-term water temperatures up to 114 degrees F (45.6 C)! Most species that go that hot live in hot springs. The impossibly hot water means that they have few to no predators, and their only major risk is humans. 
Pupfish may get around the very low oxygen concentration by alternating between the two forms of respiration, aerobic and anaerobic. Anaerobic respiration is possible for most organisms, even humans. In humans, it happens during strenuous exercise. Without oxygen, we can still make energy, but it creates a side product of lactate, toxic in high concentrations.

The name Devil Ray comes from the horn like sections at the front of their head. They, however are not dangerous. All but one species lacks any stinger at all, so therefore cannot render any harm. They actually are pretty poorly understood compared to their Manta cousins. They likely feed like their manta cousins, by filtering out plankton. 
Surprisingly, the Giant Manta Ray is not a Manta Ray as of 2017, it was reclassified as it was found to be more closely related to the devil rays. So it went from being named Manta alfredi to Mobula alfredi!",

The two toxins that are important are ciguatoxin and maitotoxin. They are found in a few organisms that herbivorous fish eat, and then the toxins are amplified into larger fishes. I thought I've done a fact on bio amplification but cannot remember. It has no taste and no way of detecting it. When a human eats these it messes you up and that's the scientific term.
The symptoms range from normal to wild. Like most poisonings it causes horrible vomiting and diarrhea, sometimes lasting weeks. Nausea is also common. It effects humans neurologically, and this is where things get wild. It can cause numbness, feelings of physical touch when there isn't some. One of the most specific symptoms is the switching of hot and cold sensation, where cold feels hot and hot feels cold. It's worse and most dangerous symptoms can cause the heart to go into all sorts of wrong rhythms. It kills about 1 in 1,000 cases, so not super dangerous, but not super great odds.
There is no cure, treatment usually involves keeping the patient comfortable and hydrated until they naturally get rid of the toxin. Best way to avoid it is to watch the types and places you eat fish! Avoid large, predatory fish and herbivorous fish in warm climates.",

While gar are frequently seen as aquarium species they are not really the best for that. Because of their large size, they quickly can outpace most habitats, and when that happens people will sometimes release them into native waterways, causing all sorts of problems. 
That's a good reminder to never dispose of fish in a way that could impact local waterways. Live fish should never be released into the wild. They could become invasive, or introduce sickness to the native wildlife. I even recommend against flushing dead or live fish down the toilet for that reason. The preferred way of disposing of a dead fish is to wrap the fish in a paper towel and seal it in a plastic bag, and then throwing that away.",

The main uses are as an additive for animal feed and sometimes for fertilizing crops. Fish meal is made from the bones, organs, and other inedible parts of fish before consumed by humans, or more commonly bycatch for other fisheries. 
As you can imagine, not everyone agrees with this. Selling fish meal makes catching species that they are not targeting something that they can make money on. If they are fishing for cod and catch a few endangered sharks, then they are happy as they can make those into fish meal. Obviously, we want to discourage bycatch and not encourage it. There's something about drying and grinding fish into a mostly useless powder that rubs me the wrong way too. There are also people who are against the use of fish meal as it is used to overfatten chickens and pigs for human consumption, and is obviously not a super organic or natural part of their diet. 
Unfortunately, the main use of fish meal, a bit more than half of it, goes towards fish farming. Fish meal is used to make fish foods used in the production of farmed fish for human consumption. As farmed fish are one of the only ways to avoid over harvesting natural habitats, it's not good that the only food for them comes from over harvesting the sea.

They are uncommon, only being collected by scientists a few times, but reported often by deep sea fishermen. It seems like these guys have hugely different lives. 
Whalefish are the most common and are bright orange-red, a color that is great camouflage in the deep water (see light attenuation fact). They're named after their huge mouths they likely use to filter feed, catching basically anything in the water. 
The tapetail has a small mouth and a super long tail. It likely hunts plankton, but it's upturned mouth points to it hanging out close to the bottom to look up and catch food. Oddly, every single specimen found of these guys was a juvenile, with completely undeveloped sexual organs. 
Bignose fish seem to be the oddest. Studies found that they have no stomachs or throats. They have massive livers and huge sexual organs, oddly, only males were found, with huge testis filling up most of the fishes' body. 
Some of these facts seemed to put together a story, so with some help from specimens from museums around the word, scientists found that not only are all the whalefish ever found female, but all three of these animals have very similar genes. In fact, they're the same species. Tapetails are the juveniles, and after a few years with this shape, they change either into the whalefish if female, and the bignose fish if male. 
This is a fantastic example of how little we know about what lives in the deep ocean, and how important museum collections are to research.

The root word in English mean spines or rough, likely a reference to the spines on the backs of fish. Oddly, this is not related to bass the musical term, as that came from Italian and Latin basso, and is much newer in the English Language. 
 Technically Bass are     Perciformes, so they are perch but not a perch perch. There is a member of the bass family, the Sacramento Perch, that is called a perch but is not related to the genus Perca, the perchyest perch. 
There are two other big groups of ""bass."" The familes Moronidae and Lateolabracidae. 
If you've ever heard of a sea bass, that's often Moronidae, both the spotted and European sea bass are in that family. However, the striped bass is also in Moronidae, many people in the US know them as ""stripers"" or striped bass. 
Lateolabracidae are the Asian basses. Mainly two species, the Japanese sea bass and the Blackfin sea bass. It's possible that these two species are not their own family but instead are members of Moronidae. Who the heck knows? 
So many more basses are around, Chilean sea bass, Peacock bass, Australian bass... All are sorta off in their own groups doin' their own things and have just been assigned the name bass based on shape or on taste. Too many bass.",

There are a ton of fish that are known as basses, but I'm going to focus on the ""black basses"" that are the most famous bass here in the United States.
Bass are a hugely widespread group that is pretty poorly defined. Some people say that the black basses are just a few random species, others say that it's the whole family, including freshwater sunfish. I'll focus even further to the largemouth and smallmouth bass. Both in the genus Micropterus.
Both are carnivores, eating mostly fish, insects, and crayfish. Largemouth bass target larger things generally, they have been observed eating snakes, birds, turtles, bats, and even small mammals. They live only in North America, though they have been introduced almost worldwide. In fact, the largest bass was caught in Japan, weighing 10.12 kg (22 lbs 4 oz.). Most fishermen only tolerate eating Largemouth Bass, the meat is said to be mushy. Smallmouth Bass are apparently better to eat.

874713213361594468,2021-08-10 17:58:01.451000+00:00,"Muskellunge are a species of pike- in fact the largest of the pike family. They are only found natively in the colder northern freshwaters of North America. Some populations have been transplanted into lakes and reservoirs as far south as the US state of Georgia, but those populations are not natural. 
Famously they are called muskys or muskies throughout the areas that they are found (could this be why someone requested this fish?). The word Muskellunge likely comes from Ojibwe and Algonquin words and was probably twisted first into French and then into English. Nowadays you don't hear Muskellunge much anymore, mostly just muskies. 
They are powerful carnivores, preying on fish mostly, but will eat anything alive that is in the water. There are reports of them eating frogs, ducks, rodents, and even a few tall tales of them eating small dogs. There are a few reports of muskies attacking and injuring humans, although none fatal. 
Knowing what they eat gives us clues to their size. The record fish was just over 5 feet long, 60.25 in (1.53 m). Huge for a freshwater fish, especially in the nutrient poor waters of northern North America! They are usually the top predators of their habitat, eaten only by things outside of the water, primarily humans. 
Humans fish for them most commonly with large artificial baits drawn in figure eight motions. They are curious and have an insatiable hunger so can often be caught if you're in the right place at the right time. They are fished year-round, even when layers of ice cover the bodies of water. Almost all fishermen who fish them recommend catch-and-release to protect the ecosystem they support.",

This is a pretty cool looking fish that hangs out mostly in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. They have a crazy body shape to help them be hard to eat, and some pretty cool coloration that helps them look hard to eat too! They have large, tube-like mouths that they use to eat mostly fish. 
So the name John Dory is a bit of a mystery. One of the ideas is that it comes from the French dor√©e jaune which means gilded yellow. To me, their oliveish color sorta makes that unlikely. Jules Verne in his fictional novel said that it was an illusion to the word Janitore- meaning gate keeper. He said that this was the type of fish brought to Jesus by St. Peter, said to be the gatekeeper of heaven. Another story says that the false eye on the fish was St. Peter's thumbprint. Some places actually call it St. Peter's fish. 
Apparently, they are quite delicious although are rarely eaten due to their odd shape. They have not been evaluated by the IUCN. I can't find too much about them being fished, but apparently they were given as a gift by the MƒÅori to questionable character James Cook when he first visited New Zealand.",

Skates, unlike true rays lay eggs. True rays have live birth. 
Skates are usually different with their fins, as skates will usually have some sort of dorsal fin while rays will not have one. Stakes pelvic fins are divided into two lobes, while only male rays have anything going on with their pelvic fins (remember male rays have claspers). 
Most surprisingly, most skates lack a barb to sting with! Instead, they have sharp points that run along their bodies that are really their only protection. 
A couple of other things that are defiantly ""not always"" sorta things: Rays are usually larger. Skates inhabit deeper water usually. Rays usually have the bolder brighter patterns. 
Skates grow slowly and have low reproduction rates so they are often at risk for population damage do to overfishing or even just bycatch.",

Over time, they oddly move northward, sometimes all the way to Mozambique! Millions of tonnes of fish push northward along the coast, causing a feeding frenzy among all sorts of animals.
 Dolphins, sharks, whales, and humans all get in on it, eating hundreds of sardines. The amount of biomass moving likely even beats the migration of wildebeests for largest migration in Africa (or off the coast of Africa I guess). 
The reason for the migration is not really well understood. The current leading idea is that it's just that, a migration. A group of sardines moves from South to North. The old leading idea was that currents literally forced them North. Sardines must have cold water. There is a large current that pushes cold southern water up along the coast when the run happens, but this is likely more of a reason why i can happen vs. a reason why it does.

The population was trawled from their deep-sea habitat, destroying populations. They did not take into account that this fish can live over 200 years and takes a long time to reproduce, meaning that the population could take many years to recover from just one take, not to mention the amount we have fished out of the ocean.

Because of our definition of fish, I usually try to avoid using words like starfish and jellyfish in favor of Seastar and Jelly. Seastar I think is just a better overall word. Jelly needs work in my opinion. Other words that I haven't really gotten a good replacement for are shellfish (sometimes I use mollusks, but that is way more than just the animals with a shell) and cuttlefish. I try to avoid the word fish in order to only associate the word fish with the animals that fit our definition, or at least vertebrates. But now that we know the true meaning of fish, we know that at one point it just meant anything that was in the water. Modern words require modern definitions though so I think it's important to change the meaning of the word fish. 
You may notice some other things that are weird about my vocabulary especially when talking about fishkeeping. When referencing the glass boxes that contain water for fish to live in I will almost always avoid the word ""tank."" I try to use it in the fish facts because it doesn't matter, but you'll often see me using the word ""habitat"" instead. Research has shown that people relate and empathize more with animals when you avoid using words that place them as objects rather than living things. That's also why I'll often avoid saying ""captivity"" in favor of ""In human care.""

They are pretty neat, and often have some cool camouflage to blend in to their habitat. They live mostly in coastal areas, sometimes even in tide pools. They eat mostly small mollusks and crustaceans. They are mostly a cold-water pacific species, but there's a few species found i n the Atlantic. 
If you're worried about them looking like eels check out their gill slits. Eels have a soft gill opening and it's usually circular. These guys have a hard gill covering called an operculum. So even if they look like it, it's still not an eel!",

So r selected species have TONS of offspring, but care for them little. Most of the energy from the parents goes into more young. Maybe a few die along the way, but some make it to adulthood! Many fish do this, think most of the larval fish, for example the Mola mola. 
K selected is having very few young, but putting a TON of effort into those young. That means that the young are often born helpless and remain so for a long time, needing protection from family. Humans are an example K selection. Some sharks have it too. 
Obviously, this is a scale and not a two-group sort of thing, there's many strategies for reproduction that don't fit these definitions. This concept ignores a bunch of outside factors and is sometimes looked at with distaste by some scientists, but it can be helpful, in my opinion, to help understand some species.

There's like 10 different fish called this, I'm focusing on Gymnotiformes, my favorite knifefish. If you remember the electric eel, you've already met a knifefish! Knifefish are a almost exclusive freshwater group. Most of them can produce weak electric fields that they use for communication, navigation, and locating prey (mostly inverts on the bottom). The exception is of course the electric eel, who produces large electric fields for prey capture and defense but we've already talked about them.
The electric fields are crazy and super interesting. Some fish can detect the electric fields, so the knifefishes often use super high frequency signals to hide from them as most of the freshwater fish are seeking out low frequency fields. But female knifefish prefer to select males who have lower frequency fields. So, males often will switch between the safer high and more dangerous low. When you put two kinifefish together that have the same frequency field, they will even change their frequencies to avoid jamming each other‚Äôs signals!  Or, as some recent science is showing they may actively attempt to jam the signals of others they see as competitors! That's some weird information-era warfare taking place for millions of years before humans even imagined it.

They are famous for their long nose, which they use for all sorts of stuff! The two main uses are finding food in muddy substrates, and for detecting electrical fields. The nose is usually called a Schnauzenorgan and is covered in receptors. 
The fish actually create an electric field that it monitors to see if there are any disruptions in it caused by either prey or by objects in the water it does not want to bump into. These fish are often kept in human care and some people actually put sensors in the water to convert their electrical signals into sound, allowing humans to figure out what's going on with them!

The video shows a ray laying upside down on a dock or something, looking unusually dry. When the person, wearing thick gloves touches the ray, its body begins to curl up and its mouth opens. The video implies that it the ray is ticklish. 
This is not what is happening. Rays are NOT humans, and do not respond to things as humans would. This ray has been flipped upside down in a habitat where it cannot breathe. It is actively dying. When the person touches it, the ray responds by trying to protect its soft underside by curling in its fins and opening its mouth. Rays do not smile. The muscles in their mouth do not allow it, nor would it be a helpful adaptation for a ray- who's mouth is always facing down. 
It is sorta cute, and videos, programs, and shows where animals are personified are often helpful to allowing humans to develop empathy that will lead to conservation, something that must be done in an effort to save our rapidly diminishing wildlife populations. But as always, these things walk a line of being harmful or cruel to the animals that are in them. I think this particular video has overstepped that line.

868591252298432592,2021-07-24 20:31:32.193000+00:00,"Okay nitrogen cycle. So fish metabolize (break down) all sorts of stuff, including proteins, one of the main sources of nitrogen. As these break down, you produce ammonia, an extremely toxic compound, the same stuff you'd find in Windex. Wild fish excrete this ammonia out of their body and it is carried away by whatever body of water they are in. However, In human care you have to worry a bit more.
The most obvious way to reduce this is to change the water. If you take out some of the water and replace it with new, clean water, you'll remove some of the ammonia and help the problem. Fish keepers do this, but it's super hard work and you can't do it quickly, changing the water too fast will kill most fish. So aquarists rely on bacteria to help. Bacteria inside of fish tanks convert ammonia into Nitrites, a compound less toxic, but still pretty toxic. More bacteria can convert nitrites into nitrates, an even less toxic (but still toxic) chemical. Plants can absorb nitrates easily, so a planted tank will enjoy that. Some fish keepers call this Ammonia to Nitrite to Nitrate pathway ""The nitrogen cycle"" but it is rather obviously not a cycle. 
These bacteria take awhile to grow, so introducing fish into a new habitat can be dangerous. Just dumping a bunch of fish into a clean habitat will cause ammonia levels to spike, killing all the fish. Most people have methods they call ""Cycling"" that they use to prepare a tank, but most take at least a month to prepare a tank. 
Make sure you do you research before getting any fish! Most of these animals require hours of effort weekly to keep healthy and happy. Never by any animal on a whim without first preparing for them. If you do so with a fish, you could be spelling certain doom for it.",

Been a long time since I have personally kept fish, so if you're a fish keeper with more recent knowledge message me and I can add your info! So there's a few things you have to stress about when keeping fish. Solutes, temperature, and nitrogen which is a solute but is a BIG one so I'ma talk about it separately. 
Solutes can be a big deal for some fish. Salt is a major one, how salty the water is can kill a fish quickly. Changing how salty the water is fast can also kill them. Most people track this and dissolve more salt water or add distilled water to adjust it. pH is usually caused by solutes in the water and is somewhat complicated. It measures the acidity or basicity of a solution. Most saltwater fish like their water slightly basic while freshwater habitats run the whole gambit from acidic to basic. Other things like minerals in the water, gasses in the water, and even other random salts can have an effect.  If you're thinking of getting started, I'd talk to a local fish shop about your local water and see what needs to be done to it to have it ready for fish. Some shops will even take a sample your water and test it for you! 
Temperature is important too, most fish you see will be tropical, seeking temperatures that would reflect that, mostly around 25 ¬∞C (77 ¬∞F). Some fish, like goldfish, are considered ""cold water"" fish that are comfortable usually at wide ranges of water temperatures. Always do your research on what the fish likes, as putting a tropical fish into non-tropical water would be the death of it. Cooling and especially heating units are available, but are often the part of a fish tank that will fail first, I recommend investing in an expensive, high quality one. For like the few years I kept them most fish that I lost were due to the failure of bad heating units. 
I think I'll wait till tomorrow to talk nitrogen cycle.",

The fishkeeping hobby has long been divided into freshwater and saltwater, with saltwater traditionally being considered much harder but more rewarding. I sorta disagree now, advances in filter technology have made saltwater animals easier, and freshwater fishkeeping has become almost as beautiful with some of the plants and planted aquascapes people have made. 
If you are thinking about taking on a fish or many fishes there are some things you should think about before making that decision. Fish are a commitment! Many can live 10 years or more and will require on average about 4-10 hours a week of your time. Most, if not all, of your time, will be spent cleaning and changing water. Fish are often a financial commitment, with some lone saltwater fish costing into the thousands of US dollars, I've seen some upwards of 15,000$ before. That's just livestock too, not even thinking about equipment, aquascaping, and water and electricity that will be required to run the habitat. And all of that money and work can disappear overnight if your power goes out and you didn't have a backup. 
All that's not to say fishkeeping sucks! It can be extremely rewarding, but you often will have to make time to just enjoy looking at your work. Make sure your fish are in a place where you will see them every day or having a ""living painting"" as they're sometimes called is a moot point.

They are small, the largest recorded is 9.6 centimeters (3.8 in). They are nocturnal and feed mostly on insects at the top of the water.
The upside-down thing is a bit weird. They are found often swimming with their bellies up and their caudal fins down, upside-down from the ""normal"" fish direction. This allows the fish to easily hide under debris, with their belly protected by the debris. It also allows them easily hang out at the top of the water and slurp in insects easily! The upside-down behavior does not develop until late in life, so young ones will be oriented how you'd expect. 
Remember countershading? That's when the tops of fish are darker than the bottoms, allowing them do camouflage in 3D space! These guys are sorta a proof of that, instead of having dark tops and light bellies, they are reversed, the countershading the opposite of what you'd expect (dark belly, light top is what they have).",

Mercury! So mercury is a famously toxic metal, in humans, it causes in small amounts depression, anxiety, confusion, and even becoming suddenly shy or insecure. In large doses panic attacks, the development of sudden phobias, headaches and failing memory, infections, and failing organs. These symptoms in humans are often permanent once they occur, and will cause permanent damage. Mercury, once it enters a body is very hard to get out. 
Unfortunately, one of the main sources of Mercury poisoning in humans is eating fish also poisoned with mercury. Many long-lived species accumulate the metal in their bodies, getting it from smaller fish that they eat, slowly building up large concentrations of Mercury. That can make them dangerous to consume in large amounts.
 In general, avoid fishes that have long lifespans, like orange roughy, tilefish, toothfish, and sharks. And avoid animals that are at the top of the food web, like bluefin tuna, sharks, and swordfish. Remember that a little bit of mercury will not harm you, but that it will build up in your tissues over time if you continuously eat it. The other thing you can do is encourage mines and industrial complexes to ensure that none of their waste includes mercury.",

They are cartilaginous fish, like sharks, so lack a hardened skeleton. They inhabit mostly warm, shallow water around the equator, but can be found throughout the ocean, from extreme depths to cold water. Some are even freshwater. 
From the previous fact, we know that rays breath with a spherical, which is helpful as their gills are often facing towards the ground. Most rays eat mollusks, crustaceans, and small fish. Some larger rays are filter feeders, feeding on plankton.
The famous thing about rays is their barb. Usually somewhere along the tail (though rarely at the end of the tail like many people think) you will find a modified scale, sharpened and covered in hooks that is a rays main defense. When at risk, a ray will try to shove the barb into whatever is harming it. Many rays have a strong venom that can cause pain, swelling, and some pretty significant damage!  Almost all ray stings are from people who step on rays while in the water, my recommendation is to shuffle your feet across the bottom when you're in the water, so you won't ever step down on top of a ray. If you get stung don't remove the barb, leave there and seek a doctor, the hooks on the barb can do some pretty big damage as it comes out. Wrap the area in a hot towel to help break down the venom. 
Rays are almost all declining due to over- and unregulated fishing. Some rays are harvested and cut into perfect circles to be passed off as scallops. Rays may seem scary but need our protection.",

The story went that there was a giant catfish (sometimes called jishin-no-uo or earthquake fish) that lived under the islands of japan or somewhere in the mud. When that catfish moves, it causes earthquakes. A rather famous god called Takemikazuchi , enshrined at Kashima, Ibaraki, at one point restrained the catfish under a large stone. This prevents earthquakes for the most part, but when the god lets his guard down, the fish will thrash, once again shaking the earth. Oddly, this catfish isn't always seen in a bad light. During the 1800's, a large earthquake struck near Edo, modern day Tokyo. This destroyed a lot and likely killed many, but those who survived saw some significant benefits from wealthy landowners paying to rebuild. In a way the catfish is sometimes seen as a redistributor of wealth and is often portrayed with coins surrounding or around him. 
Interestingly enough, catfish do seem to be able to predict earthquakes. Up to Hours before earthquakes catfish can show agitation and odd behavior, noted by both 18th and 19th century sources in Japan, and modern tests. Some tests show the catfish are up to 80% accurate when predicting earthquakes, the mechanism that allows this happen is not known. 
Oh, and apparently according to some of the Pokemon nerds in my life there's a Pokemon called Whiscash based off of this myth. Apparently it's a ground/water type, fitting due to the story's earthquake/fish background! If you look, you'll actually find all sorts of catfish associated with earthquakes in Japan!",

These cells usually are sorta star shaped, but only the center is packed with some sort of pigment. However, when stimulated, the cell moves the pigment to all parts of the cell, stretching the pigment out over a large surface area. Spreading out that pigment makes the color way more obvious, which changes their color! 
The most common type in fish is called a melanocyte, and is simply full of dark pigment. This allows the fish to change from light to dark, and change the color for many different purposes, most notably camouflage. Other colored chromatophores exist too, and have complicated names like Cyanophores, and Iridophores, but the purpose and structure are basically the same. 
Different things can stimulate these, including actual signals from the nervous system. The most studied, however, is hormonal activation. Even in tissue removed from an animal we can still activate the chromatophores by adding certain hormones. This means that humans can use chromatophores as testing grounds to see if something could harm or change the way a cell works. Start with some skin with some chromatophores, add what your testing, and then see if the chromatophore still works!",

So from even ancient sites we can find evidence of fish being used as offerings. Mesopotamian sites show symbolic fish in seals and even costumes. Oannes, described as a ""Culture Hero"" was said to be a fish-person or described as wearing the skin of a fish.  
Matsya is an avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu, often depected as half man half fish. Matsya seems to be associated with various flood myths. Hindu mythology is complex and often symbolic, but most of the stories surround a fish (or fish/human or fish/god or just god that looks like a fish) that saves someone or something from a great flood. 
In Buddhism it represents the freedom provided by water. Many Polynesian religions have fish or shark gods.  Pisces is an astrological sign related to the constellation Pisces, one of two fish constellations I can find (the other being Piscis Austrinus visible from the Southern Hemisphere).
In the book of Jonah, a book of the Hebrew Bible, a prophet named Jonah gets swallowed by a fish after being thrown off a ship. Should be noted that this fish may have been a whale or a sea monster or just a symbol for death depending on what translation you are looking at. Christianity uses a symbol called the ichthus. That comes from the Greek ŒôŒßŒòŒ•Œ£ meaning ichthus, standing for the Greek words for Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior. Islam has the story of Jonah relatively similar to the Hebrew one in the Quran.
Obviously not a whole list of fish in religion, but it shows how important of a symbol fish are to humans throughout history and even across cultures!",

These guys are from South America too, and are relatives of Piranhas, in fact they are so closely related that they are often mistaken for one another. Pacu are more often herbivores, and lack the razor-sharp teeth of a Piranha. Pacu are also often much larger. 
They are commonly sold as pets when they are small, but grow to sizes that could easily overwhelm most fish keepers. When this happens, they can be released out into the wild by fishkeepers who don't know any better. They can easily naturalize in most bodies of water and become an invasive species, as they have across the world, most notably in North America. They aren't hard fish to keep, but get huge and eat anything, meaning that they will harm other fish, or they may even bite even fingers if they are small enough to fit in their mouths. 
One was caught in the √òresund, a body of water in Scandinavia, and suddenly a bunch of reports arose that Pacu eat or attack testicles (how do we always get back to fish going after male reproductive organs?).

The name comes from Tupi language, it means ""tooth fish"". They are omnivores, they eat both plant and animal material. I say that first, because I'd like to dispel a bit of their vicious reputation. There are more than 25 species called Piranhas, so there can be some variation. Most of them are pretty small, with them in general ranging from 12 and 35 cm (5‚Äì14 in) in standard length (remember how to measure fish? Past fact callback!). 
Okay now let‚Äôs talk eating! So, these guys have varied diets, although the majority is usually fish. They have been found with seeds, fruit, plants, fish, land mammals and birds all in their stomach at the same time, so they aren't picky. They have one of the strongest bite strengths for a fish of their size and can easily tear into their food with sharp teeth. Humans often tear into them though! They are commonly eaten throughout their range. Some fishermen dislike them as a pest fish, saying they steal bait for larger or more desirable fish. 
Let's talk a bit about attacks on humans, as they do happen! They rarely attack a normal healthy adult during a normal season. Attacks are more common during times of drought or lack of food. Human activity, like damming rivers also causes an increase in attacks. They are more likely to attack someone with an injury than without, and more likely to attack children than adults, almost all fatal attacks are on children. Fatal attacks are very rare, most attacks just leave behind minor injuries. The media much like sharks portrays them in a bad light, they likely cannot turn anyone or thing into a skeleton (although some stories like the one written by US president Theodore Roosevelt seem possible but over exaggerated). These guys likely are mostly harmless in most situations. 
However as a callback, some cultural resources that think the  penis ligatures from the previous fact may have been to protect the important bits from piranhas, there are for sure attacks on that part of the body confirmed.",

This first one is gonna be a doozy of a fact, so if your sensitive or prudish I would skip this fact. Geo specifically asked for the Candiru, so here weee gooo. So generally, these guys are parasitic catfishes native to large river basins in south America. Most are super small. They are usually blood eaters, draining blood from the gills of larger fish. 
But Geo wouldn't have requested such a fish if it weren't for the stories around it. In 1829 an explorer in the Amazon heard (Never saw) that people would tie ligatures around their penises in an effort to stop this fish from swimming into their urethra. This same explorer suggested that it was attracted by the smell of urine. Tribes in the area did and still do wear various pieces of clothing while in the water, but why is not clear. The fish are NOT attracted to urine. 
Another story goes that they would LEAP out of the water to embed itself into the urethra of unsuspecting folk who urinated into the river. This is obviously false and essentially impossible. 
So, let's talk real evidence. There are a couple of very old cases noted by doctors of them entering into the vaginal canal that are likely credible. In 1997, a man claimed that one jumped from the water, into his penis (the urethra was far too small to accommodate the fish, it would have to of pried it open) then chewing its way into the scrotum. So, as you can tell, the doctors report here does not seem credible. The doctor provided some evidence, including a preserved fish with all of his spikes attached, although the doctor claimed that he had to cut the spikes to remove it. The doctor provided a cystoscopy video of pulling something out of a tube backwards, something that would have been impossible if the spikes were intact. These fish do not have teeth to chew into the scrotum either. A biologist examining this case noted that ‚Äú (you have chances) bout' the same as being struck by lightning while simultaneously being eaten by a shark."" So probs not something that happens.",

Okay so first to dispel a couple of myths. Puffers do not hold their breath as they get larger. If you think about it for a bit, you'll probably see why that does not make sense. These guys breath with their gills, so there's really no way to hold their breath. The way they inflate is actually by filling their stomachs with water. It's important to note that they fill with water and not air, air would be dangerous for a puffer to take in, as it would make them float until they could get the air out.
So, they fill up with air as a defense mechanism. Being large and round makes something very difficult to swallow, think of eating a pizza vs a round ball (sphere) of the same radius. Even harder if the ball is spiky. 
Keep in mind, these guys are going to an extreme attempt to protect themselves. They actually compress their internal organs and stretch the tissues of their skin and stomach. So puffing up is not good for the puffer to do unless it absolutely has to. People who own or care for puffers will roll their eyes at kids (or adults) who ask to see the puffer puff, as they generally don't want their animal to hurt itself.",

Anyway, the flagfish is a pupfish native to Florida. They live in slow moving water like lakes and ponds, of which there are a lot in Florida. They will even inhabit really shallow water like puddles and drainage ditches. They feed on invertebrates and zooplankton, sometimes some plant matter.

860947294143381556,2021-07-03 18:17:10.551000+00:00,"Icefishes! Okay so there are two groups called icefishes, Channichthyidae and Nototheniidae. They are both really crazy. They both inhabit super cold waters, below 1 ¬∞C, (28ish ¬∞F) below freezing! That means that the seawater they are in won't freeze, but the freshwater that makes up their blood should. Both have some interesting adaptions that would only work in these environments. 
Channichthyidae do something not seen in any other vertebrate so far. Their blood lacks hemoglobin, the protein structure that hold oxygen to take it around the body. That means that their blood does not have the red color that's expected, instead it's clear. They can do this because cold water is super saturated with oxygen and the Antarctic waters, they live in mix a lot increasing oxygen content. So they literally just diffuse oxygen out of their blood, they don't need a protein to carry it around. They have huge arterial systems to account for this. Not making hemoglobin saves them a ton of energy, a requirement when you need every bit of energy to survive. They avoid freezing by behavior, and they have antifreeze proteins.
Nototheniidae do have hemoglobin, actually they have more of it than expected for an animal of the size. They have tons of antifreeze proteins to stop their blood from freezing. These proteins are NOT human antifreeze, Ethylene glycol. They aren't gonna stop the blood from freezing forever, they are mostly meant to stop the formation of crystals as they could grow to damage the fish.",

The largest Gobiids alive are just about a foot long (30.5 cmish). 
Most Gobiids live in shallow water near shores, some live in freshwater, many in salt and brackish water. Many eat invertebrates, but the diet can vary quite a bit. 
They are fished and eaten in the Sea of Azov, and some fishing happens off of Italy, but otherwise are of little use to humans as far as consumption goes. They are colorful and easy to keep though, so are common personal aquarium residents. 
So, if we've covered Cyprinidae and Gobiidae, you know the two most numerous fish families! If you see a small fish in the water, you usually can guess that it's one of these and have a pretty good chance of being right.",

Someone asked for ""fish peen"" and I mean... I can sorta help with that. Fish do not have mammalian genitals, so I guess that's probably disappointing, but a few fish do have similar organs. 
About two bony fish families have what's called a Gonopodium, a modified anal fin that is used to transfer sperm to a female. The last few rays of the fin are modified into at tube that is inserted into the female to fertilize her eggs. Most of the fish that do this have eggs that develop internally and they give live birth. Guppies and Mosquitofish are good examples of this, both members of the same family. 
The other similar example is the claspers of male cartilaginous fishes. These are modifications of the pelvic fins that are intended to insert into the female, and keep the two close during the transfer of sperm. As the pelvic fins are a paired fin sharks will usually have two claspers, only one is inserted into the female. The other is moved aside to help allow the one being inserted to function. The clasper holds the female close and transfers sperm into her cloaca.",

The obvious answer to me is yes, however I have been told in the past that that is not something that is commonly understood. I should note that I am talking about physical pain as opposed to emotional pain like heartbreak or loneliness, maybe we can talk about fish and those sorts of things later though I doubt it.
For some reason in the past some philosophers have argued that because animals lack consciousness, they are unable to feel pain (looking at you Descartes). This is a different question, but I would like to note that consciousness has no definition that I could properly investigate in non-humans.
Fish check all the boxes for feeling pain though. The sensory organs used to detect damage and cause pain are called Nociceptors, and fish have those all over. Those nervous cells connect to the brain. Fish respond to pain relievers or analgesics. Fish have behavior and learning responses to situations that humans would deem painful. 
Obviously, a response to pain is important. Avoiding physical damage is among the most important steps to passing down your genes. Most animals have some sort of avoidance to these sorts of responses. Fish who were purposefully harmed by introduction of acids into their water or saline injected into them respond with stress responses like faster breathing and avoidance. These responses are reduced or removed if you introduce morphine or other pain killers. Injecting bee venom into the lips of salmon makes them slow down and begin to rub their lips onto surfaces. 
Zebrafish who have had salt solution injected into them even will prefer a barren habitat with morphine over a much more enriching habitat that they would prefer under normal circumstances, showing that they not only experience pain, but will go out of the way to alleviate it. 
So, I mean... I guess that has implications like to fishing and other things, but I'll let you think about those yourself, I guess.",

Heterocercal tails are common in sharks. This is where the spine goes up one lobe of the fin, making one side often longer than the other. Usually on sharks that's the top fin. Sorta rarely you can find it reversed, where the spine moves down the lower lobe of the fin- that's usually called Hypocercal.
Diphycercal Is where the backbone extends past the unlobed fin, giving the fin a bit of a bump right in the middle of it. 
The most common type of Caudal fin is the Homocercal tail, where the backbone stops before it ever reaches the tail, the tail being made up of rays. The backbone actually extends slightly into the top lobe, but that is rarely visible.
The Homocercal tail has a few categories. Forked is the most common, with the tail having two ends usually equal in length. Rounded- is pretty self-descriptive. Truncated, where it looks like the fin ends in a straight vertical or diagonal line. Emarginate is like forked, but does not fork quite as much. Lunate is my favorite! It looks like a moon!

The fin on the top side is the dorsal fin, it has many uses, but most notably it's important to keep the fish moving in a straight line and not spinning. 
Then we come to a fin that many fish do not have, the adipose fin. So this fin is still not well understood. Off the West Coast of the US, salmon hatched in hatcheries have the fin clipped off, with no obvious negative results. Some salmon seem to use their tail much more post removal though. The adipose fin seems to have shown up many times in evolutionary history, meaning that it's likely it does something because fish have developed it more than once. Many fish do not have an adipose fin.
The tail fin is called the Caudal fin. It is usually the most important fin in propulsion, being the fin that pushes the fish through the water. There are a few types, but I think that may be tomorrow‚Äôs fact! 
Moving to the bottom of the fish, the fin towards the back of the fish on the underside is called the anal fin. It mostly helps the fish stay stable as it swims forward. 
Then we hit our first paired fin, the Pelvic fins! They mostly help to move the fish up and down, and to stop or turn quickly.
Right next to the fishes‚Äô head, often on the side of the body you have another paired fin, the pectoral fins. Turning is the primary use, although producing lift, and even walking are important uses of them.
Some fish have two rare fins, caudal keels and finlets. Caudal keels are on the caudal fin, but facing the other direction. Finlets line the tail from dorsal and anal fin to the caudal fin. Both likely help stabilize the fins and provide more force to swim with.",

There are two families, one from South America that are probably the ""true"" tetras, and one in Africa called ""African"" tetras.  Both of the groups usually have that adipose fin. Many tetra species, African and True, are seen in home aquariums.

They can sense electrical fields. Every animal produces a weak field due to muscle contractions. Some sharks and fish can detect these tiny electric fields. 
They use organs called Ampullae of Lorenzini. They are tiny gel filled sacks that can detect electric fields. They can then send signals to the brain. The Ampullae are usually scattered across the shark, mostly on the nose and head.
It's likely that they use electro-sensory information for more than just hunting, too. It likely helps them detect currents, location, abundance of predators, and more. Just by detecting electric fields they likely can detect magnetic fields and temperature gradients as well. All useful info for a shark.",

Most flatfish hatch with their eyes on either side of their head, as you would expect for most fish. However, fairly early in their life, their eyes begin to migrate, literally physically move across their head to one side or another. As that happens, their mouths change shape, and they gain their adult shape. It's rather odd! Most times species are all one side or another, but among groups things can be pretty variable.

They are usually about a foot long (30 cm) and slender. They have very few scales and the fins on the underside of the fish are small while the ones on the top are large. Usually pretty brown in color, but there are spots that are not, like their oversized mouths. They live in the Pacific where they like to find rocks and other small spaces to hide in. Little is actually known about what they eat, but their relatives eat plankton. However, their weirdly oversize mouths would likely make eating plankton impossible as they cannot make strong suction with their mouths. 
They are aggressively territorial. They have these huge mouth flaps that give them their name. To compete, they will hold their mouths up to each other. It sorta looks like kissing. This will continue until one of them backs down, frequently the smaller fish will lose. They are so aggressive that they have been known to display or even nip at divers trying to observe them.",

In the Massachusetts Senate, another fish, the Holy Mackerel hangs. It is made of brass and is incorporated into the chandelier. 
The cod has been cod-napped many times. Most times as a prank or act of protest. During WWII, some people thought the cod to be made of aluminum, and therefore suggested that it be donated to the war effort, short on aluminum as a resource. The speaker of the house informed them that the cod was made years before aluminum was discovered, and that the cod was carved of wood. The speaker of the house did note that the Holy Mackerel in the Senate was made of metal though (it's brass so would have likely not have been much use to the military).",

However, rather than hunting plankton like sardines, these guys are filter feeders. 
Traditionally they are fished using similar methods to sardines. They are most frequently prepared in brine and salt.  Preserving them turns them a deep grey brown, but can sometimes be found in other preparations nowadays.  They have a super strong flavor and are now used frequently to flavor things like Worcestershire sauce, Caesar dressing and most sauces you see labeled as ""fish sauce."" 
Most of the fisheries are doing fine, but some get a little weird. They again have gone through a boom-bust cycle as peoples tastes changed. You can actually see the peak of sardines showing up when anchovies dropped! I actually don't know if those are correlated, but I'm guessing they may be.",

Sardines are often called pilchards, and usually a young or small pilchard is called a sardine, but this can vary pretty significantly. Over 21 species of fish are called sardines or pilchards. 
Almost all sardines feed on zooplankton. Many of them live in large schools or shoals in the open ocean. They are important to ecosystems as they help move nutrients from the microscopic animal world of the zooplankton (Uhhhhhh sorta) up to the macro world of fish. 
Of course, sardines are a famous food fish. They are fished with nets in the open water and submerged in brine to take them back to shore. They are eaten smoked or grilled, or more famously brined and preserved.  Famously they can be shoved into a can and preserved for very long stretches of time. Honestly, I find it a bit gross, and so have people for a while now, sardine fisheries have gone down significantly since the 1980's. Fisheries are usually sustainable, but have seen some problems in recent years in places where they have been fished for too long- the western coast of the US is a good example.
The canning of sardines has led to a few fun things. The phrase ""Packed in like Sardines"" is due to the tight packing of the fish into cans. Sardines the game is like hide-and-go-seek with the exception of when one finds the hider one shoves themselves into the hiding spot as well, until there are no seekers remaining.",

Males aggressively defend their territory against other males and even other fish. Tinbergen noticed that they would respond to fishing lures sometimes and wondered what caused that. Using more and more simplified shapes he learned that to get the response of aggression he learned that all it took to trigger the aggression is a red belly and a eye. He defined this direct trigger followed by a behavior as a Fixed Action Pattern. Stimulus-response, so when see red- fight until you're safe. Once started, a FAP is done until the end of the behavior (I originally wrote this as ""a FAP must be done to completion"" but rethought it, however that is how my textbook states it).

So a recent study has shown that about nineteen million years ago the number of shark dermal denticles (shark scales, see previous fact)  in the substrate went WAY down. From about 20% of micro fossils found down to about 1%, where it remains today. The remainder is mostly the teeth of other fish. This could imply that shark populations crashed sometime in the Miocene. If the fossils are anything to go by, that would mean that the population went down by 90%.
The research makes no major claims as to what may have caused this, but suggested an extinction event OR maybe just a significant increase in the fish species which would change the makeup of the fossils.",

Fungal infections are also extremely dangerous to fish.  They are usually symptoms of poor care, stress, or injury, but can show up randomly. Fungus can kill fish fast.

They get their names from huge teeth that they have that stick out of their mouths. The jaws and teeth help them puncture their prey, breaking open shells and hard bodies with ease. Because they dwell in cold water, their bodies actually contain a natural antifreeze, allowing them to keep their bodies from freezing (remember that most fish are much less salty on the inside, meaning that the fish would freeze before the saltwater they're in). 
In the 1960s-80s they became very popular to eat. Apparently, they have a sweet taste and are fairly easy to catch as they dwell on the bottom. Just run a net along the bottom and they're caught. This likely caused their population to crash, as catch declined 95% since 1985. The IUCN has not evaluated them, likely because they dwell in water too cold and deep to get good numbers and research going. I'd recommend against eating it none the less.",

When used in brewing, the gelatin collects small particles together into a mass that is easily filtered out to allow clarification of beer or wine. While the particles will settle eventually on their own, they settle much faster with it. This would technically make the beer non-vegetarian, and depending on who you ask or what species of fish's bladder you use, non-Kosher. Many beers are now brewed without it. 
Apparently, it is also used in the repair of parchment or canvas paintings of value, the Gelatin helping to bind torn or damage fibers.

So, a frog would come about from the mud. We obviously know this to be untrue now, but it was believed for far too long. 
Here's what a historian in the 3rd century wrote about a philosopher speaking of where fish came from ""Anaximander of Miletus considered that from warmed up water and earth emerged either fish or entirely fishlike animals. Inside these animals, men took form and embryos were held prisoners until puberty; only then, after these animals burst open, could men and women come out, now able to feed themselves."" Uh... Okay? I hate to say that was dumb, because they were working with what they had, but many it seems dumb now. 
So this is a fun one to disprove by simple science! Proof easily takes this one away. One of the examples is that people thought fly maggots spontaneously showed up on rotting meat, the rotting meat created the flies. So to test this, Francesco Redi in 1668 put meat into two jars. One he covered with cloth. The meat that was left uncovered had maggots and flies, the one without did not. Therefore, meat does not make maggots. Warm seawater does not make fish, fish do not make humans. Easy!

So this is a concept that essentially explains that as larger species are fished to a point where they are no longer profitable/around, everyone will switch to a smaller species. This would keep going down allll the way down the food web. This isn't believed by everyone and I'm a bit skeptical, but I want to state the idea in case you ever need a fun topic for a date. 
So, animals like Bluefin Tuna, Cod and Groupers have been targeted for many years. Many of those populations have suffered, and the pressure on the ecosystem has been felt. So, people have targeted smaller fish. Smaller tuna species, Pollock, Salmon all have become targets, next we move to a smaller species as those populations crash. 
So, this can be applied ocean-wide, but does not work too well. It works best when applied to small ocean areas, I.E., the Gulf of Mexico, The Red Sea, The Mediterranean Sea. If we follow this to its logical conclusion, humans would eventually be eating Jellies and Plankton. Unlikely, but I mean if there's a trend, then there's no reason to assume it will stop.",

This is an animatronic singing mounted largemouth bass. If you live in the central US, largemouth bass are a pretty common species, even to see mounted on walls like billy is. He's made of latex and plastic though.
They were invented in 1998 and became popular in 2000, and retained their popularity really though the 2000's. I first saw one around like 2003 at the state fair where they were selling tons of them. I never was granted one myself, but my grandfather had one. 
When you press the button or activate a sensor on the mount the fish is on, the fish begins to thrash about and sing a cover of a couple of songs. I remember ""Don't worry, Be Happy"" by Bobby McFerrin being like THE song it played all the time. Apparently it also played ""Take me to the River"" By Al Green, and Al says he made more money off of the royalties from that than any other distribution method. My grandfathers was motion activated and was supposed to startle people. According to a NY Times article Queen Elizabeth has one that she keeps on the grand piano at Balmoral Castle. Though I doubt it. 
There are so many variations and changes to this concept that it's not even worth listing them. There are a lot of mounted talking/singing animals out there. 
My favorite example is where one is losing battery and sounds like a demon. It's a grand ol' time. He'res an example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHchmWsrfUo",

Adults should be about 2‚Äì2.5 m (6.6‚Äì8.2 ft) in length, weighing 225‚Äì250 kg (496‚Äì551 lb). Individuals have been found up to almost twice that size though. They mostly eat pelagic bait fish and squid. 
This species is in extreme danger from overfishing. Worldwide this fish is valued for eating purposes, and populations ocean-wide have suffered with only a few escaping almost complete destruction.  They are famous in Japanese Raw fish markets. Unfortunately, conversation of this species is extremely hard as they are pelagic, so require international cooperation to conserve. 
Conservation efforts undertaken by the UN have mostly failed. CITES has protected the species from international trade somewhat it seems, and some international meetings have produced bag limits that have protected them enough for the species to slow their nosedive to extinction. Not to like hit the hammer over and over again, but please check what seafood you eat. Bluefin from ANY country is not sustainable, and should be avoided. 
As for fish, fishing and plastics are the main things I like to say you can do to protect endangered species. Check your seafood before you buy/eat it. Reduce your use of any plastics. If plastic MUST be used, ensure that it is reused. Those two things are really the scariest things facing fish today, and your individual effort will go a long way to helping all ocean animals.

Sharks are pretty cool, but at high risk from human intervention. They are targeted by finners and cartilage collectors. They are often caught or entangled in fishing gear, or caught as by catch. 
My recommendation to protect sharks is first off to avoid shark fins or cartilage like the plague. Shark cartilage does not help cure treat or prevent cancer, and the idea that sharks don't get cancer is a myth, they do. Shark fin is boring tasting and unhealthy. 
Ensure that all your seafood comes from good sources! If you are in the USA, my best recommendation is to get your seafood from locations and fishermen IN the USA. The United states has strong laws protecting shark stocks and endangered species. Elsewhere, I'd use seafood watch, (https://www.seafoodwatch.org/) to check up on such things. 
Never, NEVER, NEVER leave trash on the ground. Any trash left even in the center of a landmass will wash to the ocean. Not to mention animals it will hurt along the way. That one is easy. The hard one is that we have to reduce the amount of plastic we use. Reuse as much as you can, and try to stop using as much as you can to protect animals like sharks.",

When older, they actually move a lot vertically in the water, which is weird because they lack a swim bladder. They can migrate even hundreds of meters (May as well be yards- just an estimate) in the water a day. 
They used to be fished for their eggs as food for humans, but that's been declining recently do to the drop in popularity in salted roe as a food.

The fossils you mostly find of them are teeth. The teeth are HUGE, seeming to hint at an absolutely massive predatory shark. The problem is that almost all fossils are fragmentary, meaning that we can‚Äôt get an exact size on them. Estimates usually range from 14.2‚Äì20.3 meters (47‚Äì67 ft) with about 10.5 meters (34 ft) being the current most accepted estimate (smaller than the whale shark at 15 meters (49 ft)).
They likely relied on eating large mammals and other large sharks to survive, almost like the great white does today but in much grander a scope! So, this sorta points to something that's been going around on pop culture recently. The sudden thought that maybe this massive shark still lives in the ocean. While it's true, there have been massive animals in the ocean that we have missed for many years, the impacts they had on ecosystems were observed. We see no sign of ecosystem effects from a gigantic predatory shark. Likely a shark of that size would need to eat like a whale or dolphin a day at least, and we haven't seen any of those animals vanishing in large amounts. It's just extremely unlikely that an animal with that large of an impact could stay under the radar for so long. 
They MAY have gone extinct as recently as 3.6 million years ago though, which is fairly recent as far as how long sharks have been around (some estimates put them extinct 36 million years ago, not nearly as impressive)!  Changing climates as well as changing ecosystems likely killed this species. A harsh cooling period may have limited their range and reduced how well they could hunt. Large predatory whales also start becoming more common during this time, and being warm blooded likely had an advantage in cold seas. Mammals in the ocean began to decline, likely reducing their food supply. Maybe more on them later!",

Grasping teeth are used to hold on to slippery slimy fish so that they cannot escape. Cutting teeth are usually wider and have serrated edges that they use to tear apart prey. Crushing teeth are flattened into plates that are used to break open the shells of animals like crabs, clams, and shrimp. 
When I was in Georgia, USA, people would specifically beachcomb looking for shark teeth! If you get a chance to visit a local beach search any piles of small rocks or material for some teeth! (And always take a bit of trash off the beach as you go!) Not promising you'll find any but maybe it'll be a good activity.",

Water gardens became popular in about the year 610-910. Many people would get carp for this, and would selectively breed the carp who had an orange gold color rather than the usual silver. Eventually they became extremely popular, and were being kept indoors by 1644. Many different breeds, shapes, colors, and sizes were developed during those thousand years. 
As soon as Europe heard about these guys, they became valued there as well. They were given in marriage to represent prosperity. 
Goldfish eat basically anything, and are extremely messy. When kept in home aquaria they stay somewhat small, but are capable of growing up to 19 inches (48 cm). 
They are commonly kept in situations that are not appropriate. They grow quickly and require strong filtration to keep their water clean. They are not very good starter fish, but have been positioned as such. Because they don't require heat and are tolerant, they can live awhile in bad conditions, they will eventually die early.

841456676393451550,2021-05-10 23:28:25.161000+00:00,"Hey! So I've already fishfacted about gills(3/3/2021), but I want to clarify and expand a bit. So gills are basically tubes with very thin walls that oxygen can diffuse across. Blood basically locks the oxygen inside of it and delivers it around to the parts of the water that need it. 
Flash asked a question today, I'm sorta rewording it but: ""Why don't we have something like a gill that a human could use under water?"" The main reason why is that gills require blood to work. So if you wanted to set up a human to get their oxygen from the water you'd have to basically hook up your heart directly to a gill- even if artificial. You'd have to basically replace your lungs in your circulatory system with a gill. 
That sorta begs the question, why don't gills work in air and or why don't lungs work in water? The difference is between the actual physical characteristics of the two mediums. Water is much more viscous than air, so we've made different ways to get the oxygen. We basically have sacs we inflate like a balloon, easy in air because it flows easily out of small tubes. Water does not, so fish have gills that basically just have water flow over them. Water also has much less oxygen in it than air, so our lungs would have to work roughly 20 times harder to get the same amount of oxygen out of water than air, essentially impossible.",

There's lots of subspecies that are fairly common and can interbreed with standard Nile Tilapia, so it can get complicated identifying them.

Lake Kivu- into the Congo. Lake Malawi into the Zambezi. And if you count it Lake Turkana, of which there is no outflow. 
These lakes play host to some of the most beautiful freshwater fish species in the world. More than 1,500 cichlid fish species live in the lakes, most of them endemic, found only in those lakes.

For a very long time, French fishermen have been able to cross the waters around the British island of Jersey, only a few kilometers (milesish) off the coast of France. With the UK leaving the EU, the rules around British waters are becoming much stricter, and therefore boats technically should not cross unless they can prove that they have historical fishing documentation. Some French Fishing boats docked in Jersey as protest, so
the UK sent two gunboats to Jersey. France responded by also sending a Navy presence. 
As of now, the fishing boats have left the port, and the British Navy is calling the situation ""Resolved"".  And says they will pull the armed ships back soon. They also have ominously noted that they will be available to address any more ""situations"" that happen near Jersey. 
If you are in the UK or France, I'd be interested to hear how it was reported to you. The press in the United States seems to be admonishing the UK press for calling it a ""war"". 
All in all, this is likely a result of the hasty leaving of the EU by the UK, with a trade deal that had to be drawn up quickly in order to not completely mess things up. I hope that over time things will be more clear and hopefully more open. The leaving of the EU has inflamed problems that have occurred in the past (Called the ""scallop wars""- not fish so I don't think I'm gonna comment on them).

They are bred originally from the Amur carp, an Asian species of carp that lives in the rivers of Laos, China an Vietnam.  The wild form is a solid brown orange color. Koi themselves have been bred over probably hundreds and thousands of generations to have colorations of red, orange, black, and white. 
Koi remain a freshwater fish that thrives in water that is cool, but not cold. They are almost always kept in outdoor ponds, so they are often easy targets for wild predators and domestic pets like cats. They are omnivores, so eat most anything you can give them, most people use a special made Koi food. They are rather hardy, and if kept healthy may live upwards of 100 years. Some studies have found that some older Koi may be over 200 years old. More likely they will live up to about 50. 
There are many different varieties of Koi, and each one has a special category that it can compete in for Koi shows. In Japan they are considered national symbols and are representative of luck and perseverance in the face of adversity. There's a group in Japan called the Zen Nippon Airinkai that regulates all of the breeds and organizes the shows. They are sorta the Koi kings.",

I may have already spoken about them but I like them so here we go. They live in the Pacific and Indian Oceans off the coast of Australia and New Guinea. They hang out on coral reefs and tidal pools eating inverts and sometimes a fish or two. 
They have pretty obvious markings, usually a light tan color with black spots often surrounded by white. They usually have two black spots right above their pectoral fins, false eyes meant to confuse predators. That's where their name comes from, they look almost like military epaulets. 
These guys can almost ""walk"" across reefs and hard substrates. They use their fins and the shape of their bodies to shuffle their way across the rocks and corals. Famously like mentioned in previous facts they can even walk on land if the want to! 
They breed easily in human care, and are very common sights in both public and private aquaria. They are docile and rarely bite, but will protect themselves if you hurt them. They are small though, so can do little harm. They only grow to about 54‚Äì64 cm (21‚Äì25 in).",

They are sometimes called turkeyfish, due to their long feathery like appearance. They are native to the pacific and Indian Oceans. 
Obviously, the big story is their venomous spines. They make the lionfish overall not eaten by many fish. Only a few fish will eat them. The spines are covered in skin, and as the spine goes into whatever they are envenomating, venom flows over the spine and into whatever they are seeking to sting. They can cause extreme pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, breathing difficulties, convulsions, dizziness, redness on the affected area, headache, numbness, and sweating in humans. The most common effects are pain and redness. It can rarely cause death, especially in those allergic or young children. They are edible though and are eaten fairly often.
The reason why they are eaten so often is they are extremely invasive. People who kept them in aquariums have let them loose in the Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean and Mediterranean.  They eat almost anything that's alive, and generally are not eaten by any other animal. Some reefs showed up to an 80% decrease in populations AND diversity after they showed up. There are many efforts to reduce or remove their populations, most notably by hunting. These guys are hunted and killed mostly for food- I hear they make good fish tacos. Generally, they are spear-fished.

Again, these guys are large, mobile, open-sea predators, eating mostly fish and using speed to capture their prey. They can grow up to 16.4 ft (5 m) and are commonly fished for sport. The main way to tell the difference between a marlin and a swordfish is Marlins have a much smaller bill or rostrum. 
So a few things I should have mentioned in the previous fact. Both the marlin and the true swordfish are often quoted as traveling at that 110 km/h (68 mph) mark. This is likely an extreme exaggeration, and they probably don't reach near that, but I suppose possibly could. The marlin is the faster of the two. That long sword-like rostrum you see on them is an odd adaptation that is used mostly for feeding. They will not spear or impale anything on that, rather they jam it into a school of fish and thrash it around, seeking to hit and stun fish making them easier to catch. 
I believe Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea features a fisherman who is fishing for marlin. That's likely from Hemingway's own experiences, marlin can be found near one of his favorite homes in Key West, Florida, USA.",

Few animals will eat adult swordfish, aside from the largest sharks and killer whales. However, they have been found to host more than 50 parasites, some only found on them! 
Swordfish are eaten. They are taken by harpoon and deep-sea fishing. At times their stocks have been very low, but after some protection the stock in the North Atlantic is healthy and probably okay to take from. Swordfish should not be eaten frequently or by children, pregnant women or women who may become pregnant. They have high levels of mercury in their tissues.",

To do harm something must force the venom below the surface of the skin. Many fish do have venom! Catfishes make up the majority of venomous fish, but there is likely about 1200ish non-catfish venomous fish. Fish make up the majority of the venomous vertebrates, about 2/3rds of the venomous vertebrates are fish. 
Most fish deliver their venom via spines in their fins or by modified scales that are sharpened and shaped to deliver it. The most common spine to be envenomated is the dorsal spines (spines on the back). This is likely an adaptation to protect them from predators from above, and make their shape much more difficult to eat. Many fish have more than that envenomated though. Sting rays famously have a modified scale close or on their tail that is used to sing or deliver their venom. 
Reef stonefish are the most venomous fish, a dose of about 13 mg (uhhh... like 0.0002 of a teaspoon for imperial? I dunno 0.0005 oz) is enough to kill a person. It's a mixture of a bunch of protein-based toxins that cause extreme pain, shock, paralysis, and tissue death, not a fun time. Medical care is required as soon as possible, but hot water and tourniquets can be applied to break down the venom and stop it from moving around.

So, the little guys have been used for basically every type of genetic experiment, including some of the weird ones. So, Zebrafish have had genes added to them via transgenesis, the insertion of genes from one animal into our animal. In our case a zebrafish. So, the gene that was inserted into them was the gene for Green Florescent Protein, from a Jelly called Aequorea victoria (This protein is often called GFP and it is SO important, the discoverer was awarded a Nobel Prize). 
Adding this protein was supposed to make a fish that could be used to detect water pollution. If suddenly you found a bunch of dead glowing fish, you obviously have a problem. It's much easier to see bright colored fish than dark ones was the thought. That's obviously a bad idea, there's no way a neon green fish is going to survive in a freshwater ecosystem, they will just be immediately eaten. So that didn't work.
Only the initial few zebrafish had the genes added by humans. All the rest are descendants of the original ones. You've got all these glowy fish and nothing to do with them. They then were advertised as a fish for people with home aquariums. They proved stunningly popular. They are now trademarked and copyrighted under the name Glofish (Trademarking animals is a whole thing I'm not ready to talk about). You have likely seen these guys in pet stores. They have the same easy to care for temperament and fun colors- for the kids I guess... I dunno. After the initial green guys were made, other florescent proteins were found from various other animals, mostly corals, making red, purple, orange, pink, and blue fish. So if you want, you can have a genetically modified pet. 
The way the genes were added is crazy, and might be a later fish fact- we'll see.",

Usually, there are two different crowds. The daytime fish are called diurnal, meaning active during the day. They are often the fish you see in photos, active and brightly colored. These guys mostly base their ecology on eating zooplankton and other small things out of the water. Nocturnal fish are also common on the reef. These guys have large eyes and powerful senses, like smell and their lateral line. These guys are active predators mostly, seeing out fish to eat. However, there is one time on the reef dominated by an eerie absence of movement. The last minutes of light in the evening and the first few in the morning are often known as the ""Quiet period."" A time when the reef, for a moment, seems abandoned. 
The reason is probably due to a few things. Bright-light eyes of the daytime fish quicky drop in usefulness as it gets dark, meaning that they cannot see well during the twilight periods. There are fish, mostly predators who are adapted to this light who hunt the reef heavily during this time as well making it extremely dangerous for most daytime prey. Animals that are active during dawn and dusk are called crepuscular.",

Examples for fish include where the land ecosystems fade into the ocean or freshwater body. This can be amazing for fish, they are protected from the predators of the deep ocean, while having access to all sorts of food sources, especially insects and other land animals. 
Locations where freshwater bodies of water meet the ocean are also ecotones. Think of estuaries where rivers pour out into the ocean. The river dumps tons of nutrients into the ocean making a fantastic place for filter-feeders and the animals that eat them. This also creates water that is slightly salty, but not entirely salty, sometimes called brackish. Estuaries are used by tons of animals as nurseries to grow up in.",

The oceans have lived for thousands of years as their own ecosystems, mostly unbothered by land animals, with a few notable exceptions. That is until humans came along. Humans are weird though. 
Humans target fish for their size, sex, coloration, and taste. When we fish we can eliminate entire populations within years. Much of this evidence is anecdotal but pretty compelling. 
Cod used to grow to huge sizes and mature late in life. After years of fishing targeting larger mature cod, the population now matures earlier and is on average smaller. Humans have taken most of the cod that had genes for large sizes, leaving only the smaller cod. 
 The same can be seen in behavioral adaptations. If a fish species is easy to target with a certain fishing method, only the fish that avoided it would survive. Making that fishing method overall less effective on that species. 
Those adaptations are helping them to survive, making them beneficial, and strongly selected for. It's pretty interesting to see that humans are having a not insignificant effect on populations of animals that we hardly understand.",

Mutualism is where both benefit. A cleaner shrimp cleans an eel‚Äôs skin. The shrimp gets food, the eel gets cleaned, everyone's happy. 
Competition is when both are hurt. Both fish want to eat the same food, so they hurt each other simply by reducing the amount of food available to both.

This should be impossible. This shark was taken from the wild before she was sexually mature, and has never been in contact with a male since. There was no way her eggs were fertilized by a male. Some people thought that one of the other two species of shark in the habitat may have been the father, but after the pup died the real truth came out. 
The pup had no DNA that the mother did not have. This shark was fertilized by the mother. The mother shark was reproductively normal. The fertilization happened via parthenogenesis.
Parthenogenesis in this case was ""automatic parthenogenesis."" Two of the mothers' egg cells came together to form a complete genetic code. This is probably an adaptation for species like sharks who live in the ocean where they may never see another of their species to reproduce. Keep in mind that the reason for sexual reproduction in the first place is to mix genes to hide the bad genes and highlight the good ones, so automatic parthenogenesis is not really the best idea unless it's a last resort to continue your genetics. Because the mother had no y chromosomes, the baby will always be female as well. 
Virgin birth like our bonnethead has been documented a few times, but in the wild is likely more common than we think. There are other types of parthenogenesis too, but we'll get to those later.",

So, I often use the common name to name a fish, but there's a problem with that. There are fish with hundreds of common names for one fish species. Every language and region and even household can have a different name for a fish. 
Often the most commonly accepted common name is the one given by fishermen, but the problem with that is we end up getting things like starfish, whitefish, and everything named some sort of trout.  Not really descriptive, and often legitimately misleading. 
So biology has what‚Äôs called binomial nomenclature. It is often credited to Carolus Linn√¶us but that's complicated so I'm not gonna get into it. Long story short other people were already doing it before him but he did lots of stuff.
For fish, it's even more complicated. Often, you'll hear the default set of names, Domain, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species. Well.... That's hard for fish who have so many groups and types that there have to be subfamiles and Infraclasses and subclasses and superorders bleh it gets scary. What most people need to know is that most fish will have a two-word name. That will be the Genus and Species. A good example is Mola mola. Mola is the genus, and mola is the species (genus is capitalized species is not). The whale shark is Rhincodon typus. The Betta is Betta splendens.

True puffers when NOT puffed up will usually show no external spines. They remain among the most poisonous vertebrates in the world, specializing in tetrodotoxin a very dangerous poison. This is the dangerous fish to eat you hear about being prepared in Japan, Korea, and China. Many species lack poison and are eaten as delicacies as well. Puffers' body shape makes them slow, but maneuverable. Their first defense is to outmaneuver their preditors. Next, they will try puffing. The puffer fills its stomach with water, forcing its body into a basically inedible ball. There's a myth that dolphins use puffers to ""get high"" or as a recreational drug of some sort. This is a very anthropomorphic way of looking at it. We don't know what effect Tetrodotoxin has on dolphins, and we don't know why they act the way they do. It's more likely just natural playing and exploring behavior. 
Porcupinefish also have many of those traits, but their spines are visible even when they are not puffed, although the spines usually lay flat against the body.",

Walleye are a freshwater fish native to the northern part of North America (If you're European, it's a close relative of the Zander or Pike perch). In some places, you will hear them called pickerel. They are fairly large for a freshwater fish, growing to an average of 80¬†cm (31¬†in). Walleye are exclusive carnivores, eating primarily smaller fish, but also crayfish and sometimes leeches can be eaten. They are not endangered but are protected by fishing laws and limits in most places to avoid overfishing.
Okay, not sure I believe this because of just how dumb it is, but apparently they are called walleye because of their outward-facing eyes, ""Eyes that look at the walls- walleye."" 
Walleye are edible and are prized as a fishing target. Walleyes are most easy to catch at dawn and dusk into night, and during really rough water conditions, sometimes known to fishermen as ""Walleye chop.""

Patrol ships began to change off fishing ships. The Icelandic coast guard began using net cutters to cut the nets of fishing ships. Fishermen began to fight back by throwing rope trying to entangle the propellers of the Icelandic boats. They would blast ""Rule Britannia"" over the radio and refuse to identify themselves. The only fatality of the conflict happened when ICGV¬†(Icelandic Coast Guard Vessel) √Ügir¬†collided with a British frigate while trying to arrest a fishing vessel. An Icelandic engineer named Halld√≥r Hallfre√∞sson, died by electrocution from his welding equipment after seawater flooded the compartment in which he was making hull repairs. Iceland once again threatened NATO and the UK backed down, allowing the range expansion. 
The third and possibly final war was in 1975-1976. Iceland, along with many other countries expanded its waters to 100¬†nmi (185¬†km). Then Iceland expanded its fishing protections to 200¬†nmi (370¬†km). This one played out much the same but had significantly more net cuttings and rammings than all the other wars. A British fisherman may have been killed by a cable snapping back on him when it was cut by an Icelandic patrol boat. The British in total deployed 22 military frigates, some with specialty hulls intended to ram. There was a total of 55 ramming incidents in the 3rd cod war. Once again, Iceland threatened to close its NATO bases and the UK came to the table to discuss. They agreed to keep out of the 200 nmi range as long as they could allow 24 vessels to fish 30,000 tonnes of cod. 
The overall winner of the Cod wars is for sure Iceland. They have protected their fishery and expanded their waters much further than they originally could. Unfortunately, this caused thousands of fisherman in the UK to be out of work, and about 1 million British pounds of damage to the royal navy.",

The problem is that UK fishing ships are not allowed into Icelandic waters. For many years this was not a problem, as international laws only had a nation's protected waters stretch a few miles offshore. However, the UK itself helped expand that range out. 
The first cod war began when Iceland expanded its territorial waters from 4 to 12 nautical miles (7.4 to 22.2¬†km). All members of NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Association, an alliance with a variety of other nations that Iceland has) opposed this expansion. The UK sent military vessels with their fishing fleet to continue fishing. There were protests outside of the British embassy in Iceland, and the ambassador responded by taunting the protestors and playing loud bagpipe music. Icelandic patrol boats tried to remove ships from fishing in their range but often were met with the full force of the Royal Navy, something little Iceland could not contest. So they resorted to threats. During a time when NATO was incredibly important to both the US and the UK Iceland said they would leave NATO if they did not come to an agreement. The United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea between 1960 and 1961decided that Iceland could have 12 nmi (22 km), but with some space seasonally available to UK fisherman.",

Cod is a family of fishes including a few different species. Almost all of them have a white flesh that is prized in foods, especially fish and chips, which we spoke about earlier. Other species have the name cod in their name, but are not members of the real cod family. Examples of that are the Murray Cod of Australia, the Potato Cod of the Indo-Pacific, The black cod of New Zealand, and the Lingcod of the Pacific Northwest.   Side note: sometimes Pollock, Haddock, and whiting are all often sold as cod. This is false they are not cod. 
True cod are active predators, eating everything from fish to invertebrates.
Historically, the main cod fishery has been the Atlantic cod around the UK, Iceland, and Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada. The fishery in the UK crashed out early, and now is so small you're unlikely to find cod around the UK. The Canadian population used to be the largest in the world, some people said you could walk out onto the water on the backs of cod (not likely to be true, it's a deep-water dwelling fish). That population crashed in the 70's- 90's and has never recovered. 
The Icelandic population is doing okay... And the subject of many problems that I hope do talk about in a future fact, this one is already running long.",

It is a horrid combination of a breaded fish chunk, a slice of american cheese, and tarter sauce on a white bread bun. In France apparently it gets the name ""McFish"" which is gross. 
The fish in the sandwich has changed a bit over the years. Alaska Pollock is what is used in the United States. Millions of tonnes of fish are removed from the area of ocean between Alaska and Russia every year just to make this gross sandwich. (Sigh if you actually like the sandwich don't worry, if it‚Äôs fished in the USA it is sustainable) 
Apparently it is made of different fish depending on what country you buy it in as well. New Zealand Hoki seems to be the main other option, but I cannot confirm that. Hoki is likely less sustainable than Pollock, but still somewhat sustainable.

Devil's Hole is a crazy habitat. Those who have been into it describe huge underwater passageways connected by tight tunnels. No one has ever mapped the bottom. It now lies within Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge, in Nevada USA. The pool shows reactions to even very distant geologic activity, with earthquakes in Chile and Japan causing significant splashes. 
Seeing as Devil's Hole pupfish may be the rarest fish species on earth you'd think they'd be well protected. They are now but didn't use to be. A few people have died illegally diving in devil's Hole (the bodies were never recovered). Some drunk idiots broke in, swam, and threw their trash into the pool. Even the loss of one animal could be catastrophic. 
Many people have tried to turn Death Valley into farmland by drilling wells. This cuts into the water table and lowers the level of the water. Seeing as the pupfish only lives in the upper bit, that would destroy their only habitat. This was fought for a long time, ending with a Supreme Court of the United States ruling that the groundwater legally can be preserved to protect cultural and scientific resources. People during and after the court case have suggested poisoning Devil's Hole to kill the Pupfish or the habitat that sustains them-hence the ""Kill the Pupfish"" sticker. Fences and barbed wire have been built around Devil's Hole to protect the fish. 
Humans have moved pupfish to an off-site location that has been successful in keeping pupfish happy and healthy. Millions of dollars have been spent on the protection and housing of this species. 4.5 million alone on the housing facility. The pupfish is amazing though, and a precious natural resource. They can survive in situations few other fish could, and have so many valuable research opportunities. One conservationist said killing the pupfish would be like dropping a bomb on the Louvre.",

Their diet is algae, plankton, and small insects, they are only 30 mm (1.2 in) long. In their natural habitat in 2019, 136 pupfish were counted. 
The population is protected, with huge fences around devils hole, but that hasn't stopped problems. People have broken in. Farming wells have dropped the water level, almost destroying the pupfish.

They live in lakes and rivers and often prefer very good water quality. The species of the group are scattered across South America, Asia, Africa, and Australia, suggesting that the common ancestor was on a supercontinent when those landmasses were together. You'll sometimes hear them called bony-tongues, which is an accurate description. They are usually specialized top feeders, catching insects and birds right out of the air above the water. 
They are famous pet fish as well. They come in beautiful silvers, golds, and reds. They grow large, and any keeper who has space and time to house one is likely trying to show off. The Asian Arowana is endangered and therefore banned from import to the United States, but is still kept by thousands of people illegally. Asia is where the trade in Arowana is the most important. Japan, China, Singapore, and many other southeast Asian countries have established them as a symbol of luck and/or wealth. Some Asian Arowana (the species) sell for over 300,000 American Dollars $. If you're ever interested in this crazy world check out The Dragon Behind the Glass a book by Emily Voigt. It is a fantastic exploration of the Arowana and the people who are interested in it. 
The Asian Arowana is endangered due to capture for the pet trade, although almost all the pet trade uses breeding facilities with high fences and armed guards. Habitat destruction for palm oil plantations is a huge problem as well.",

The most defining feature of these guys is their elongated shape, with the largest one recorded being 26 feet (8m). There are apparently unconfirmed sightings up to 56 feet (17m).  They live in the deep ocean, 660 ft (200 m) to 300 ft (1,000 meters). They are most often seen swimming vertically when in their natural habitat. This is likely to be able to see their prey in silhouette. However, they have rarely been seen in their natural habitat. Almost all human sightings have been animals that are dead or dying and have been caught or washed ashore. 
These guys likely contributed to the myth of sea monsters. They would wash up on shore and be described in words as a massive snakelike fish monster, and people would run with it. There are some weird things about them. A report by some scientists in New Zealand reports that they gave electric shocks when touched. Something that hasn't been observed before or since. Oarfish in Japan can be interpreted as a sign of earthquakes to come.

Plankton is frequently defined as any organism that is primarily moved by the ocean‚Äôs currents. So, most fish are not plankton at least as adults as they can swim against the currents if they so choose. People used to think that the Mola was just moved by currents and therefore thought that they were plankton. With further study we know that that's not true, from the past fact you know that they swim pretty fast. 
However, many fish are plankton especially early in their life! Anything that is only plankton for a bit of their life is known as meroplankton (the opposite is holoplankton). A ton of fish do this. Often when looking at plankton nets you can find hundreds of larval fish. These planktonic fish are sometimes called Ichthyoplankton. Being in the plankton can help spread your species out, using the ocean currents to move you far away from where you were born, spreading out the species.

Muse wanted to hear about the largest bony fish on the planet, at about 3.3 m (10 ft 10 in) in standard length and weighing over 2,300 kg (5,070 lb.) in mass (and weight I guess bleh imperial). Huge. They are     Tetraodontiformes, the same order as pufferfish, and porcupinefish! The group is defined by their four large teeth at the front of their mouth! 
If you haven't guessed yet.... We're talking about *Mola mola*, the Ocean Sunfish. I find the name sunfish a bit confusing, so I mostly use Mola, but the name sunfish comes from the tendency to sometimes lie flat in the water and bask in the sun.  Mola I think are UNFAIRLY maligned. These guys are fairly intelligent (I don't like this word but this is a response to a specific argument), fast, and important. 
Sunfish are generalists! They eat lots of stuff, a lot of small fish and famously jellies and salps! They swim at a cruising speed of 3.2 km/h (about 2 mi/h) which may seem slow, but they can swim fast if they need too, possibly even leaping out of the water to avoid predators. 
While they do reproduce a lot, they lay 300,000,000 eggs the most of any vertebrate, almost all of those will not make it to adulthood. They are vulnerable as they are used by humans‚Äô foods sometimes, and as caught as bycatch.",

The reasoning behind this is light and energy. The sunlit layer is the only place where phytoplankton, the creatures that generate energy from light, can live. Phytoplankton form the base of the open ocean ecosystem. The problem with that is the sunlit later is super easy to get eaten in. Visual predators lurk and dart around, able to catch anything that is in the brightly lit water. So, if you want to both get the nutrients from the sunlit zone and stay safe you have to find a way to hide. The deep ocean only has one hiding spot, the deeper darker water. Every day the largest movement of biomass on earth is the movement of these animals up and down in the water, up to eat, down to hide (mostly, this is sorta an oversimplification). 
So that means that these animals are taking HUGE amounts of nutrients down and up every single day. This has been named ""The biological pump"" and is extremely important to the planet-wide ecosystem. The deep ocean is likely the largest sink of CO2 we have, so the animals move carbon from the upper water where it will diffuse into the upper atmosphere to the deeper water, where it will be trapped for years, maybe even decades. So those lanterfish are among our strongest all allies in fighting climate change.",

So for basically ever sounding has been the way to find the depth of water. A long rod or a rope with a weight is lowered into the water till it hits the bottom. This would tell you the depth of the water and allow you to make charts of where a boat could safely go. 
During WWII technology to find things underwater became immensely important. So sonar was developed. Sonar is the use of sound to find things in the water. Basically, a noise is made underwater and you time how long it takes to bounce off the bottom and come back to the point where the sound was made. 
This technology was amazing. They could find the bottom much quicker than with sounding, sometimes in just seconds. There was a problem though. Sometimes when testing sonar it would find a bottom that was hundreds of meters shallower than what sounding showed. Not only that, but this false bottom moved up and down depending on the time of day. 
They had discovered the deep scattering layer. A species of fish called lanternfish, or Myctophiformes hangs out at depth. They are EXTREMELY numerous and have swim bladders that reflect sound well. These animals chase plankton that they eat up and down in the water column. This makes what looks like a false bottom to the ocean. Now sonar has been updated, it can ignore the deep scattering later.",

Like their relatives' sharks and rays, they don't have any bones, instead relying on a skeleton of cartilage. Unlike sharks and rays, they don't have any type of scale. They often have a venomous spine used for defense. From their grinding teeth, they are likely carnivores who prey on things with shells (although like most deep-sea carnivores they are likely opportunistic and will eat what they can get). 
They have all sorts of adaptations for deep-sea survival. Large eyes help them see, their lateral line system is prominent, and their bodies are soft and pliable to allow them to better tolerate the pressure. 
They are targeted for a few reasons, in Australia and New Zealand where for some reason they are called whitefish and sold as food. (What is with those two and consuming cartilaginous fish like they're cod?) One odd use of them is their oily organs can be used to extract a clean oil that was used to lubricate guns (can't really find a good source to confirm this... Gun experts can you confirm?)! These pressures are nothing compared to the problem of bycatch. When fishing for other types of fish, mostly for eating, they can get caught in the same nets. That can be hard on a population like the spookfish, who can live up to 30 years. Make sure you take a close look at the seafood you consume and ensure that it's taken from someplace sustainable! (Again Monterey Bay's seafood watch is a good place to check up on https://www.seafoodwatch.org/)",

The main attraction to these guys is the electric part. They use this for a few reasons, to hunt, to stun, or kill their prey, for navigation, and communication. They have muscles and nerves that are stacked in such a way that it forms almost a battery, and they can use a nervous signal from their brains to fire them, opening ion channels and creating an electric field. The muscles used to do this are called electrocytes or electroplaques. In case you ever need to impress your friends when animals produce electricity it's called bioelectrogenesis.  
These can be fired in very small amounts to be used for navigation and communication. Disruptions or interference to a weak electric field can be a sign of another eel or an object they're gonna bump into. They can use them at slightly higher power to cause animals around them to twitch slightly, creating movement that they can detect to find their food. At full power, these electrocytes can be used to stun or kill prey or protect from a predator. 860 volts at 1 ampere is the most they can produce. Enough to possibly kill a human depending on where it is applied (usually .1 to .2 amp are considered lethal, but it's complicated). This strategy of using strong fast electric pulses to hunt or stun prey really only works super well in freshwater, as saltwater has a different conductivity. 
I'd like to hear from any electricians, physicists, or electrical engineers who can correct any information I got weird here!",

They usually have obvious, large, pectoral fins and live in the shallow sunlit zone of the open ocean. They can be found in every major ocean in the world. They eat plankton and are commonly eaten by many different open ocean predators like dolphins, swordfish, tuna, squid, and birds. 
These guys are famous for their escape mechanism. These guys propel themselves up and out of the water and use their large fins to glide through the air for short distances. On average they can glide for 50¬†m (160¬†ft), but have been known to be able to do 400 m (1,300 ft). They can utilize wave and wave height to their advantage and they can also catch updrafts to help them. Keep in mind that this is not true flight, it's only gliding. 
If you're ever on a small to medium-sized vessel in the open ocean keep an eye out for these guys! They will leap on being disturbed by the boat. Sometimes they can even leap to their death onto the deck of the boat. These guys are eaten, apparently, they are used in Japanese cuisine, and are highly sought after on some Caribbean islands, specifically Barbados. No species that I can find is listed as endangered, although some populations are facing strong pressure from fishing. In Barbados for example fishermen have had to continuously move south to pursue the fish as they are overfished in the range they used to cover.",

They were likely the largest placoderms, with the largest species at 8.79 m (28.8 ft). All the placoderms are extinct, including Dunkleosteus. They existed during the Devonian, the previously mentioned ""Age of fishes.""
It's likely the armor of Placoderms was the result of an arms race between predators like Dunkleosteus and other placoderm prey. Unfortunately, bony fish came around and were likely just faster, sleeker, and better. The heavy armor of Dunkleosteus probably made it slow and lumbering, unable to catch and keep up with early bony fish.",

The lateral line system is a system of mechanoreceptors, similar to touch. But instead of actual physical contact, they are meant to detect movement in the water. 
The system usually relies on two different locations for little sensory cell groupings called neuromasts. One type is inside of a channel that runs along a fish, and some are just scattered on the outside of a fish. 
The canal neuromasts are helpful when there's a lot of water movement, as the canal filters out the background currents and flows. 
This allows fish to detect movements in the water, in an effort to help them hunt or to avoid predators. The lateral line system is what makes it hard to catch fish by hand. As soon as they feel your hand enter the water they're alerted. 
Some fish who have bad or no vision use the lateral line system more than others.",

So in general I like to divide fish into two major groups, saltwater, and freshwater! Saltwater is water that is high in ions, mostly sodium and chlorine (table salt), but about a ton of other things as well. Freshwater is lower in those ions, it's the water you drink. Rivers, streams, lakes, and ponds are all commonly (but defs not always) freshwater. The oceans and seas are usually saltwater. Remember that this is a scale, so some bodies of water can be only slightly salty. Slightly salty habitats are usually referred to as brackish. 
Fish inhabit both, but are much more diverse in saltwater, probably because 97% of the water on earth is saltwater.  
Fish face different problems in both, primarily due to osmosis, the tendency of things across membranes (usually cell membranes) to reach a balance. In saltwater, salt wants to rush into the cells and water wants to rush out. In freshwater water wants to rush in and salt wants to rush out. Both of these are problems that are solved in various ways. 
Fish probably started in freshwater, though there is some evidence that bony fish may have started in freshwater and moved into saltwater. Still, this is argued quite frequently. 
Osmosis is probably one of the most important things in biology.

We know whale sharks have internal fertilization and carry their young, but they have never been observed being born. We have only witnessed mating twice.

That can form via a few means, ice can concentrate the salt by only freezing water with low salt content. Underwater salt deposits can dissolve into the seawater. Or, other geological activity can do it, like the vents we saw in an earlier fact or the cold seeps just a fact away. The salt in these pools is ULTRA concentrated, it is so salty. It also carries lots of nutrients that animals can use. 
The brine itself is too concentrated for most life. Most animals that fall into the brine will die fairly quickly due to lack of oxygen and toxicity of that much salt. But animals will surround it due to the large number of chemicals that can be used to create energy. If an animal falls in, the corpse will likely remain there for years, as the anoxic condition makes decay very slow.
 I love looking at these ecosystems as they are so alien! Many of these ecosystems would survive for years even if the sun went dark or if the earth was ejected from our solar system. They don't rely on the sun, so even when all life on the surface becomes frozen and gone, the life at the seafloor relying on geology will likely persist.

Methane is a gas at the temperatures and pressures humans live at, and to cool it to the point it would be a solid would take way more than even what the oceans can provide. So it forms a clathrate hydrate. That means that water forms a crystalized structure around it that traps the methane inside. Methane itself is almost all biologically generated through various means, but most of the methane in the atmosphere is created by ruminant digestion- sheep or cows farting/releasing it in other ways. 
Methane is an extremely powerful greenhouse gas. Much stronger than carbon dioxide. Huge amounts of methane are trapped on the seafloor in these ice/methane complexes, that when melted could release that methane into the atmosphere, causing a rapid runaway warming effect, where more methane means warmer which means more methane. This is called the clathrate gun hypothesis, and is probably not the most pressing and urgent situation with climate change, but is absolutely terrifying.

Cold seeps are where different energy-rich fluids and gasses seep up from the bottom. They aren't colder than the water around them- but they are cold in comparison to hydrothermal vents. 
There are a lot of different types of them, but all are caused by geology, mostly tectonics I'm told. As these energy-rich chemicals are exposed, life begins to colonize them. Bacteria start to break down chemicals like methane into energy and form the basis of a food web. Just like what we saw in hydrothermal vents, these animals depend not on the sun for energy, but on the breakdown of chemicals. 
They are different in a few ways though. Hydrothermal vents can go away quickly, or change in intensity extremely fast, leading to a volatile and intense ecosystem. Cold seeps do eventually end, but they are dependable and constant throughout their life, leading to a longer-lived, stable ecosystem. 
The cold seep plays host to mussels, tube worms, crabs, and even some fish species! The tubeworms and mussels both have bacteria in their tissues that make energy from the various chemicals in the water. The fish generally rely on the predation of some of those animals! Fish are fairly uncommon at seeps, and the few species that do live there likely ONLY live there, meaning that they are probably at a pretty high risk of extinction. 
Seeps are at a pretty high risk of human impact. Pesticides and fertilizer have already been found even at that depth. Humans have even considered mining or harvesting the hydrocarbons that form the basis of the whole ecosystem, and that would obviously be catastrophic.

The pacific salmon are far more common and well known, with the Atlantic Salmon falling somewhat into obscurity. There are other animals called Salmon too, but they aren't ""true"" salmon. 
Salmon are famous for their life cycle! Salmon lay their eggs in freshwater, where they hatch out and then migrate to the ocean to finish maturing. Switching between saltwater and freshwater has some crazy chemistry having to do with osmosis which we may have time to talk about in another fact. 
This migration is super important for many ecosystems! The salmon take up tons of nutrients from the ocean and during their migration back upstream to lay eggs carry those up those streams to supply all sorts of animals along the way! Bears famously hunt them as they migrate. After they lay their eggs they die, leaving the nutrients behind to be taken up by all sorts of animals and plants!
Salmon are famously eaten fairly often, and are both still wild caught, and increasingly, farmed! The flesh is nutritious and has a pink color to it. Over fishing is a problem for these guys, so farming is good news! When choosing a fish to eat, try and make sure it was harvested sustainably.",

The slippery dick is a small wrasse species native to the Atlantic Ocean, from North Carolina south to Brazil. It's most common in the warmer areas, prevalent in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea. They need shallow coastal water. It feeds on invertebrates like crabs, sea urchins, snails, and sea stars. 
Slippery dicks are sequential hermaphrodites, just like we learned about in the very first fact, they begin life female and switch to male later in life. the coloration changes with them, but they are famous for their pastel blues and pinks that they maintain somewhat throughout all their life states. The colors can vary though so don't get too caught up on the colors. 
The slippery dick is of little value to humans simply because of its small size. It is evaluated as least concern by the IUCN and is prolific across its range.

So fish oil pills are made with a variety of different animals. Mostly the oiliest fish, herring, tuna, anchovies, and mackerel are all common. Sometimes they're made of liver oils of sharks and cod.

Fish and chips consist of some sort of fish that has been battered and deep-fried and potatoes that have been cut into long rectangles and deep-fried (french fries for us Americans). The dish probably originates in England in the 1860s. It's since spread across the world with British colonialism. 
The weird thing is the type of fish that makes up the fish part! (I'm sure there's a potato person who's interested in the chips but not today.) Cod and haddock are the most common in the UK, with cod seeming to be by far preferred. There's a long story about the UK and cod, including a ""war"" with Iceland, but I think that will be its own fact. Apparently in Ireland ray is commonly used. 
Australia goes weird with this using reef cod, barramundi, or flathead. Many Australians will tell you that flake is the best fish to get. Flake is actually a species of shark, usually the gummy shark. 
New Zealand uses ""lemon fish"" a species of shark, snapper, tarakihi, or gunard. 
The US uses all sorts of fish for this, and it's pretty regional. The south often uses various types of catfish. Flounder, halibut, tilapia, and even sometimes cod or pollock. 
Anyway, part of the point of this fact is that even with some of the most familiar dishes there can be a huge variation in what it's made of. Some of these species are sustainable, others are not. Keep an eye on the seafood you eat or buy, even if it's covered in delicious breading.",

So, we all know the story of the deep blue sea, and the color of the ocean is still something that I'm not sure I understand, so give me some time to research that. But, water attenuates light, meaning that as it gets deeper, it gets darker. 
The weird thing is that different colors of light are attenuated faster than others. So blue light makes it super deep, while red goes away the fastest. So think of images taken underwater without lights. Even in a shallow swimming pool, things look slightly more blue than red. 
That's why red coloration is pretty common at depth. Red-colored fish simply appear dark once they go beyond a few meters underwater. Many fish super deep in the water have even lost the ability to see the red spectrum of light at all.

These are often things like trees, songs, birds, foods, dances, soil types, art pieces, and surprise, fish! Almost all of the 50 states have some fish as a state symbol. Many of the coastal states have two, one saltwater and one freshwater. Often these fish are especially common or of commercial importance. Only two states have no fish specified, Indiana and Ohio. If you live there get on it, we need more fish. 
10 states have the same fish as their state symbol, the brook trout, by far the most common. Georgia, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Vermont, and West Virginia are the creative places you can thank for that. The next most common is the Cutthroat Trout and the Striped Bass, both tied with 7 states.

So to start, I should at least mention osmosis (hold on keep reading I swear it will be fun). Osmosis is basically JUST the movement of particles from where there are many to where there are few. So if you have two rooms in a house and one has 40 people in it, they're going to spread out to fill both rooms comfortably. The more crowded the room, the faster they'll leave.  Same with particles inside and outside of cells. 
So if you have a bunch of oxygen outside of your blood it'll rush in quickly. If you already have oxygen in your blood it'll rush in much slower. The most oxygen is in the water as it enters the gills. So fish do something weird. They make sure that the most oxygenated blood touches the most oxygenated water. That basically ""tops off"" the blood. Then as you move through the gill, you'll find the least oxygenated blood coming in contact with the least oxygenated water. Because there's so little oxygen in the blood, what's in the water still rushes in. Without counter current exchange, you would only ever get 50% oxygenated blood, as it would reach an equilibrium between the water and the blood. By using it you can sometimes remove 90% of the oxygen from the water. Check out the diagrams, they do a better job of explaining. 
The same thing works with heat rather than oxygen. Let the coldest blood touch the coldest parts. Even you have some counter current exchange happening, your kidneys use it to filter the gross stuff out of your blood.",

Gills are located just past the head of the fish and are on structures called gill arches. They usually open just on the side with an opening covered by an operculum. 
The gills usually have the thinnest blood-to-water barrier so they are basically where all of the things that require diffusion into and out of the water. Including oxygen transfer, nitrogenous waste elimination, and salt balancing.
Gills work by having water flow past small almost hair-like structures called gill filaments. The tissue of the gills is super thin, allowing particles to basically (this is a big basically, there's a lot that has been very simplified) just come in or leave the bloodstream or blood cells.
 As they go by the oxygen dissolved in the seawater diffuses into the blood. There is some crazy plumbing that assists that, the same system that helps with heat does that, but I think that'll be its own fact. 
Gills are the main excretory organ in fish, playing the role that kidneys play in humans. Fish also have kidneys, so they also use those (maybe we'll get to this in a fact? I dunno).  They excrete ammonia and ammonium directly out of their gills (essentially peeing out of their gills-but they also actually pee). Fish usually (some very much do) do not convert the ammonia they produce into urea as mammals do, they just excrete it directly. We may talk more about this later. 
Fish have two main ways of moving water past those gills. Buccal pumping and ram ventilation. In buccal pumping, you open your mouth to fill it with water, then close your mouth and force the water out past the gill. In ram ventilation, you just swim forward with your mouth open and let the water pass by your gills. The ram ventilators are the ones you hear about who can never stop swimming. If they stop, their gills stop working.",

Discus are native to the Amazon and are pretty commonly kept in home aquariums. They're notorious in the fishkeeping hobby for being picky. 
They are one of the only types of fish that actually provides for the babies. After the babies hatch, they'll latch on to mom and eat some of her slime coat, the layer that protects the skin from bacteria and viruses (see above fact). The slime provides nutrients and gives the babies important bacteria that they need in their digestive system to survive. The babies will stay around the mother until they are large enough to survive (usually about 14 days), but discus is a social species so they will often stay in groups.",

815953945587220480,2021-03-01 14:29:40.319000+00:00,"Okay here's a fun little bit about the fish circulatory system. So a circulatory system is what takes oxygen from where it's collected (in fish usually gills in humans lungs) to the rest of the body. For fish, this is going to be the heart that does the pumping and the veins and arteries that carry the blood, which itself carries the oxygen. 
Humans have what's usually referred to as a 4 chambered heart, with one side pumping blood to the lungs and one side dealing with pumping blood to the body. Fish hearts (usually) only have 2 chambers, meaning that they only have only one loop for the gills and the whole body. 
This would be a good time to scroll down and look at any diagrams I posted as stuff can get confusing without an image to associate with it! 
So, let's start as a non-oxygenated red blood cell in the heart. The heart will contract and squeeze, forcing you to the gills where you will acquire oxygen! Then you will be pushed again to the body where you will deposit your oxygen with the body. Then you return to the heart! Easy right? Well...
An animal needs the blood to be always flowing, or else some part of the body will run out of oxygen. Human hearts achieve this by having two parts to the heart, a lung side, and a body side, so flow keeps going. But fish only have one closed loop. 
The problem with a single closed loop is that a heart pumps by contraction. If you think of the noise a human heart makes you probably hear the bum-bum noise of the two sides contracting one after the other. A fish heart only has one ""bum"" as its noise.
If the heart of a fish is currently contracted, no new blood can flow into the heart, it needs to wait to enter the heart until it's not contracted. Fish have an extra bulge next to their heart called the sinus venosus, a spot where blood can wait before entering the heart. After the heart, there's a part called the bulbus arteriosus (sometimes called conus arteriosus) that keeps blood moving while the heart is not contracting.",

We've discussed their slime already, feel free to go back and check out that fact if you're interested. Hagfish do have a scull, but they lack true vertebrae, meaning that they are only sorta fish as they don't fulfill one of the most important parts of our definition. They do have something that's ALMOST like vertebrae and that's close enough for me. 
Hagfish are usually pretty small, around 19 inches (30 cm) in length. They vary in size a lot though, with some being spotted at less than a third of that length. 
They do have eyespots, although they are not super great. They probably represent the very early vertebrate (all animals with a backbone) eye. They could probably use it to tell light from dark, but not resolve actual images. Telling light from the dark is important for fish, as a predator swimming above you will cast a dark shadow. 
Hagfish are scavengers. They eat everything from marine worms to the largest dead and dying sea creatures. Their bodies are so bendy that they bend themselves into knots to give themselves more leverage to yank off chunks of what they're eating. 
Hagfish are not endangered but do have some interactions with humans. Eelskin we've already talked about. They are eaten in Korea as a specialty dish, and are often pests to fishermen worldwide, as they can start eating the catch before the fisherman can pull it up.",

Obviously, that's not the only way the color of the fish can help it to survive. Let‚Äôs talk about disruptive coloration.
Disruptive coloration is patterning or colors that is used to break up the shape of the fish. This occurs because vertebrates- both prey and predator- define something with its outline. Shape is among the most important things for identifying an animal. 
Fish take advantage of this. Dark stripes on their bodies make it look like chunks of their body are missing, braking up the obvious fish shape. Many lie-in-wait predators have odd stripes on their heads that makes them look really weird head on. Fish aren't the only animals that do this, when you think of disruptive coloration, think of a zebra. The stripes are meant to confuse predators. 
This also applies to shape. Often you will see a really odd fish shape, and that may be to break up the obvious fish shape for predators. Jackknife fish are my favorite example of this, although there are lots.",

So on the ocean floor, there is this thing called hydrothermal vents, they generally spew hot chemically laden water out for geology reasons you can ask geo about. Around these vents, ecosystems spring up based not on the energy of the sun, like the vast majority of life on earth, but on the energy in the chemicals being spewed out. This is called chemosynthesis. A few fish have adapted to live in this ecosystem. We're talking some extreme conditions too, water that would be hot enough to boil if it wasn't under such extreme pressure, at some vents 250ish atmospheres. 
Ratfish, our friends the chimeras live down there preying on some of the filter feeders and other invertebrates. These guys are cartilaginous fishes like sharks and rays- but really entirely unlike sharks and rays. 
There's a bony fish too! It's often called Pink Vent Fish and it eats the filter-feeding and bacteria farming animals that live around the vents. Being red or pink-colored is an adaptation that I want to talk about later. 
Vents are a new part of biology, they were only discovered in the 1970s. There's still lots of cool stuff to learn about them!",

(Different from fluorescence where you glow under a This can happen via multiple pathways and we might talk about those later. Fish are the only vertebrates(animals with backbones) that have it. 
Counter illumination we talked about earlier in the countershading part. That's where the light is used to match the light from above, helping them blend in. 
Communication is another good reason for lighting up. myctophids (lantern fish) are probably the most numerous fish on the planet, and they likely use their small lights to help find your species among many. 
Probably the most common reasons for bioluminescence are either to kill or to not be killed. Anglerfish can use lights at the end of their lures to attract their food. Some fish will flash brilliantly when under attack to scare away the predator. I'd be frightened too if my meal started flashing at me. 
I think I'll save some of the other parts of bioluminescence for a later fact to keep this one short and sweet. Don't want it to turn into another swim bladder fact.

So many bony fish (not sharks or rays recall earlier fish fact) have an internal organ called a swim bladder. This is a sac filled with gas that allows them to regulate their position in the water. Add air to the sac and you're more buoyant, remove it and you sink.  
Some fish have swim bladders that directly connect to their digestive system, so they just need to go to the surface and swallow air to fill their bladder. They can get it out in the opposite way. If you're thinking this is starting to sound like a lung, you'd be correct! Some fish can get oxygen out of it in that way. The swim bladder is where lungs started! So your lungs are likely  the equivalent of a fish's swim bladder.
Not all fish come to the surface for their swim bladders. Some fish use crazy chemical reactions to pull the gas they need to fill their swim bladders from their blood.
Moving up in down can be bad for this organ. Gases expand as you move up in the water column, and if you do that too fast it can become a major problem. You see this sort of thing on fish that are pulled up from the deep sea by fishermen. 
Humans use these swim bladders in a lot of things! Because they are filled with air, sound travels differently through them. Sonar, the use of sound waves to detect underwater things, therefore can detect fish. If you've ever seen a fish finder that is what it's doing! It also leads to the deep scattering layer, something spooky sounding that I want to save for a later fact. 
Swim bladders are high in collagen and are sometimes harvested for beauty products. Some beers use isinglass to clarify their drink, isinglass is fish swim bladder (making some beers non-vegetarian). Unfortunately, swim bladders, especially of endangered species are also taken for traditional medicine. Loud noises like those produced from blasting or oil exploration can damage fish swim bladders simply with a shockwave.",

Enter helicoprion, my favorite fish fossil. The helicoprion fossils almost always form these beautiful spirals of teeth, starting small at the center of the whorl and getting larger as you move out in the spiral. The spiral was almost always all that was found, as the teeth were the only part that fossilized. 
So people ran wild with this fossil. They knew it must be a shark because of what was preserved of it and where, they just didn't know where and how this tooth whorl was located. Many early reconstructions put the tooth whorl on the top jaw spiraling out, or the bottom jaw looking like some sort of tooth whip. Some of the more outlandish guesses put the tooth spiral on the dorsal (top) or caudal (back) fins. By a stroke of luck, we found a fossil that was so well preserved that we can see the cartilage. 
This puts the tooth whorl firmly in the lower jaw, likely with just a portion visible, and the visible part slips into a slot in the upper jaw. This allows the shark to have a saw that could be used to cut into hard shells and eat the animals that built the shell. 
Our friends Helicoprion are all extinct. In fact not only is that genus extinct, but the whole order is also. The closest living relatives are probably the chimeras, a weird group that I hope to get to in a future fish fact. 
I hope to add all sorts of reconstruction images here, remember that these are a mixture of science and art and not what they actually looked like.",

There are 3-4ish major types of scale. One of the types is the dermal denticles of Sharks, and we already talked about that one, you can see a discussion up above. These are sometimes called placoid scales. 
The two most common types of scale are cycloid and ctenoid. The main difference between the two types is the presence of teeth along the edge of the scale. 
Ctenoid scales have these teeth  They aren't true teeth, they are just little bumps that run along the edge. 
Cycloid scales are defined by a lack of bumpy edges. They are rounded and smooth. 
Those two types of scales are closely related and are often grouped together as leptoid scales. Completely separate from that is ganoid scales, the scales of ancient fishes.  These are diamond-shaped usually, and used as armor. They are thicker and stronger. Nowadays you'll only really find these on fish like sturgeons, gars, and bichirs. 
There are a bunch of subclasses and other types, but it turns into word salad fast so I'ma just leave it there.",

I had a request for ""Fish with Knees"" which I am going to use to talk about something I've wanted to discuss for a while: the main split in different types of (bony) fish! Remember that the cartilaginous fish are their own group. 
So, here's the split- Lobe-finned Fishes vs. Ray-finned fishes. Lobe finned fishes have fleshy lobes that extend usually in 4 spots on their bodies that make up their fins. Ray finned fishes have spines or soft tissue that makes up their fins. The two names for the groups are Sarcopterygii and Actinopterygii. 
I want to focus on Sarcopterygii today though because they're the ones with knees. I could cheat here and once again explain that technically humans are part of Sarcopterygii, as all tetrapods came originally from lobe-finned fishes. Okay I will cheat then. All tetrapods probably trace their lineage from a fish-ish creature called Tiktaalik. He's extinct now, but had lobed fins that he possibly used to walk on land with! He lived during the Devonian, often called THE AGE OF FISHES.
As far as things we can for sure call a fish that is a lobe finned fish there are far fewer examples. The lungfish are lobe-finned, they use those bony fins to help them walk. The other example is coelacanths, still completely aquatic and water breathing. They were thought completely extinct for many years, and are often called living fossils. 
There may be more on both Tiktaalik and coelacanths in later facts! There will defs be more facts about the Devonian.

812417245615095868,2021-02-19 20:16:05.337000+00:00,"Okay, new request! Catsharks! Catsharks officially are a family of sharks, with the official name of Scyliorhinidae. Catsharks are one of the largest groups of sharks, with probably over 170 species! The are bottom dwelling, meaning that they spend almost all their time sitting on the bottom of the ocean, a lifestyle called benthic (But be careful with this word, I might use it later in a different sense).  Like most bottom dwelling fish, they eat invertebrates that live on the bottom and scavenge other food if they can get a hold of it. 
Catsharks are easily confused with some carpet sharks; some carpet sharks live on the bottom and have similar patterns. The way to tell the difference is that the eyes of a cat shark are always pretty obvious as that's where they get their name. Cat sharks have weird looking long eyes, reminiscent of a cat. The other main difference is fin placement. Cat shark's dorsal fin (the one on top, think the fin that you see sticking up out of the water before a shark attack in movies) is set waaaayyy back on their body. 
One of the more unfortunate things about letting mostly fishermen provide the common names of fish is that they often cause problems. Many sharks that are in the family catsharks will often be called dogfish. This can create a large amount of confusion and I mostly try to avoid it. The main group I refer to as a dogfish is the spiny dogfish, a whole other family in a whole other order.",

This is a fairly common type of camouflage among fish, a light belly and a dark back. The point of this is so that the fish when looking up will camouflage in with the lighter top of the ocean or sky. When looking down the dark back will camouflage in to the darker depths of the ocean or the bottom of the body of water. This adaptation is very common among animals that live in 3D space (not stuck on 2D land). Because fish can have danger coming from above and below them, they need camouflage for both. Countershading provides a great means to hide from predators from the air as well, so you will sometimes see it on land animals as well, especially those who dwell in the trees (lizards often have countershading).
Some fish take this to the extreme, and have bioluminescent organs on their undersides that glow with the same brightness and the light above, allowing them almost active camouflage from below. I hope to talk about bioluminescence in a later fact, but I figured that was important when talking about countershading.",

But nobody said the backbone had to be made of bone. Fish have their skeleton mostly on the inside. For the bony fish they have a hard skeleton made up of bone, basically the same as most human endoskeletons. The order of bony fishes is Osteichthyes, but they are sometimes called Teleosts, as many of them are in the group Teleostomi. The classification gets wayyy complicated. These are your seahorses, groupers, perch, eels, clownfish, Mahi-Mahi, Bettas, batfish so on. There are a ton of Teleosts. 
The other group doesn't have hard skeletons, but they still have to have a backbone to be a fish. They cheat and make their endoskeleton out of cartilage, the same stuff that makes up your ears and nose (If you want touch your ears now if you can wash your hands before doing so, remember not to touch your face with unclean hands. Feel how you can bend your ear but it still bounces back to shape.). That means that They can bend their bones just like you can bend your ear, but only to a point, the cartilage still can break. Most use this to their advantage, using cartilage ribbing to help the bounce their tails or fins back into position after using muscles to move them. These guys are your sharks and rays (and a few others we may talk about later), Chondrichthyes is their order. That's why when a shark decomposes, all you have left are teeth and jaws, the only hard part of a shark. The rest is cartilage. If you've ever seen a megalodon jaw and wondered why we have the jaw but not the rest of the fish, this is probably why (don't worry, shark fossils are a special favorite of mine, we'll talk about them soon).",

Standard length ends where the actual fish ends, right before the fin rays start. Fork length measures to the shortest section of the tail, usually where the tail forks. Total length goes to the very end of the tail. Science usually uses standard length. Fishermen usually use total length, as it makes their fish seem bigger. I've only seen fork length used once or twice, usually for a specific purpose- like if the fish has an unusually shaped tail.

Seahorses lack scales, opting instead for bony plates that cover their whole body. Their fins have been reduced or for some fins are completely absent. Because of the lack of fins, they are pretty poor swimmers and opt instead for using their tails to hold on to branchy objects. 
Since it's Valentine's day I should probably go into seahorse courtship, which is long and complicated. It lasts several days depending on the species, with a male and female hanging around (and on) one another. The long courtship dance ends with the female inserting an ovipositor (egg-laying tube) into a males pouch and laying up to 1,500 eggs inside of the male's specially made pouch. 
This is where you get the story that male seahorses get pregnant. This is sorta true I guess, but it is not true pregnancy. The male only holds the eggs, he does not nourish them. 
As the eggs are laid, the male releases sperm into the pouch, and the eggs are fertilized. The eggs sit inside the male for 9-45 days, depending on the species. The female continues to check on her mate daily in most species. Once the eggs hatch, the male pushes the babies out of his pouch and leaves them to fend for themselves. 
This adaptation is probably in an effort to share energetic requirements for reproduction. If you remember the first fish fact, females spend a lot of energy making eggs, so caring for those eggs after they're laid would be even more cost on top of that. Having the males do it shares that energetic burden. It can also allow time for the female seahorse to develop new eggs, as growing and forming new eggs takes a lot more time than sperm. 
Seahorses face many dangers, including habitat destruction, being caught as bycatch, capture for food and aquarium trade, and they are often harvested for traditional medicine. I hope to talk about Traditional Medicine later.",

Almost all fish are covered in a coating of slime, used mostly to protect the fish. The slime probably limits the amount of fungal, bacterial, and viral infections that make it to the skin. It also can help prevent parasites from attaching to a fish. Some fish have more slime than others. 
This is the reason that when you're working with live fish that you want to keep alive you touch them directly as little as possible. Touching the fish scrapes off the layer of slime, leaving their skin and scales open to attack by all sorts of bad things. So, the next time you go fishing, do your best to touch the fish as little as possible if you're releasing them. Try to never touch pet fish. 
Green moray eels are a weird example of fish slime. They are actually a brownish color, but the slime that they secrete is a yellowish color giving them their characteristic green look. 
Hagfish, again only sort of a fish, have some of the craziest slime around. About 3-4% of a hagfishes' mass is slime. Just so much slime. When under stress or in danger they secrete even more, meaning that they can quickly become slimy messes. This slime can gum up the mouths and gills of any animal that tries to eat them, making it a good protection against predators too! Hagfish also slide past their own bodies a lot, meaning that the slime is also used as a sort of lubricant.",

This means that animals that you may think of as eels, like gunnels, electric eels (a type of knifefish), and spiny eels are not TRUE eels. Speaking of true eels, you have heard or seen a leather product listed as ""eelskin.""
Eelskin is, surprise surprise, a lie. It's not made out of eel, or really anything like eels. It's made from our old friend, Hagfish skin. So, when you think you're buying a fancy purse made of exotic eel skin, you‚Äôre instead buying a purse made of one of the grossest animals I can think of (hagfish fact still incoming). True eel skin would dry up pretty quickly and not make very nice leather I don't think. 
Another weird eel fact is their life cycle. This one is weirdly entwined with many different stories. For many years nobody knew how the American or European eel reproduced. Sigmund Freud, famous for his iffy theories in psychoanalysis, spent a long time on this. When he was first starting out, he wanted his contribution to science to be finding testes of eels. He killed over 400 eels and cut them open searching for their reproductive organs, finding none. Talk about having a complex- he wrote some crazy letters about how they haunt him and stuff. Turns out eels reproduce far out at sea and he was dissecting juvenile eels that hadn't developed their sexual organs yet. Whoops. 
Eels are used as food in some places, even leading them to be overfished! If you ever get a chance, jellied eels looks like a tasty snack if you like meat in unflavored gelatin. In some places eels are even farmed in an effort to reduce wild catch and increase supply.",

809566863180038184,2021-02-11 23:29:41.207000+00:00,"Okay, for Rudy! Mahi-Mahi are a species of fish that can be found pretty commonly in almost every ocean, with the exception of the far north and south. They are big and beautiful, when they're alive they have bright yellow and blue metallic coloration. They have weird shaped bodies with huge foreheads, one of my books said ""...think Charles Laughton in The Bribe."" No clue what that means but okay. 
They are called by like a million different names, including Dolphin. If you've ever been served dolphin in a restaurant, chances are this fish was what you were served. The actual mammal dolphins will not be discussed here. Mahi-Mahi means ""very strong"" or something like it in Hawaiian. The name is often used to help sell the fish as a food, as calling it Dolphin does makes people spooked. 
It's actually a pretty good fish ecologically to eat! They have very short lifespans so don't accumulate a lot of mercury, and in the United states are usually very sustainably fished! When buying fish, try to always ask where it was fished. If you'd like to check if your seafood is safe I recommend Monterey Bay's Seafood Watch: https://www.seafoodwatch.org/ .  Here's a secret about me: I don't eat seafood so I dunno how good it tastes but I asked some people and they said it was tasty.",

You've seen eels and hagfish already, both of which completely lack scales. So it's pretty clear that this isn't hard and fast. Interestingly, there are like 4 types of scales, the most interesting in my opinion being dermal denticles. Dermal denticles are what sharks have. There can be hundreds of thousands of these covering a shark's body. The word denticle has the same prefix as dentist, so I think you may be able to guess where this is going. Each one of those denticles is basically a tiny tooth. They are made of dentine, the same stuff your teeth are made of, have roots, and are covered in a layer a lot like the enamel that covers the outside of our teeth. Dermal denticles are there likely for two reasons. Their shape makes tiny vortices which reduces drag, making them much faster. Some swimsuits try to recreate this and have actually had to be banned in the Olympics for uncompetitive advantage. The dermal denticles also prevent any animals from latching on to the shark.",

808717621406597205,2021-02-09 15:15:06.190000+00:00,"Alright! So next up is gills. The phrasing of this one is purposefully wiggly because of how many exceptions to this one there are. Gills are the way a fish breathes, they're basically thin membranes blood flows through so it almost touches the water. The proteins and compounds in the blood pull the oxygen dissolved in the water into the blood, and the heart pumps the blood around the body (fish hearts may be a future fact). If all you need is a thin membrane to transfer oxygen, all of a sudden you've got more options than just gills. Air usually has WAY more oxygen in it than water, so many fish have tried to figure out ways to use that! One of the more common examples is the Siamese Fighting Fish, or the Betta (side fact: it's pronounced beh-ta and not bay-ta). These guys in the wild live in shallow streams and ponds that often have very low oxygen concentrations. So they do something weird, they swim to the surface and gulp air. Their digestive system uptakes the oxygen they need from the air. This is actually why bettas are often kept in bowls or cups of water that would easily kill almost any other fish. Because they don't need oxygen in the water its quality doesn't matter as much. I've got some strong opinions on Betta care, but I'll restrain myself. Just always do your research before getting a pet. 
Other fish have adapted almost lungs! The lungfish have modified air bladders that they (with one exception) always fill with air to get their oxygen. Their gills are mostly useless. These modified air sacs are probably the beginnings of the modern vertebrate lungs that you have inside of you! 
Many fish also have some way of breathing through their skin as well, but that isn't an exception to the definition as their primary way of getting oxygen is still their gills.",

So fish have sorta screwed this one up. There are tons of examples of where this doesn't happen. Many eels completely lack fins aside from what is almost a tail fin. Batfishes have adapted their fins into almost little legs, as have tripod fish. Flying fish use their fins to glide through the air. Anglerfish have fins that are shaped like food to lure prey! Some fish have even adapted a fin to act as a sort of pseudo-penis to deliver sperm. I'm going to save lobe-finned fishes a later fact I think.

A lancelet has a backboneish thing (for sure not a real backbone, but close) and even gills (not for breathing but for feeding). Fish likely evolved from Lancelets. Lancelets are cool, but I consider them a fish ancestor and not a real fish.

This rule is a little more hard and fast. I can't think of something you'd call a fish that is only on land, but there's some that sometimes are! 
The ancestors of tetropods (anything with four legs, frogs, mammals, reptiles, even you) have early lungs and can survive on land for a long time! Some lungfish are obligate air breathers. They have damp skin and slime so they have to stay a bit wet though.
Eels, mudskippers, catfish, sculpins, and famously the Northern Snakehead can all hang out on land with different degrees of success. Most of these fish either respire through their skin or they use parts of their digestive system to breath (this probs will be the fact if we talk about gills). Northern Snakeheads, a freshwater fish native to Asia, have accidentally been introduced to multiple places, including the United states. They're quite hard to control, because they can and will literally get out and walk across land to a new body of water, spreading their invasiveness.
There's only one shark that can hang out on land, the epaulette shark! They hang out in shallow reefs with strong tides, so as the water lowers, the shark can get trapped in shallow pools. They survive by shutting down their organs so they don't need oxygen and then basically walking across to a new spot! It's pretty neat!",

Many fish buck this! Some of the most famous examples are Tuna, who sorta regulate their body temperature! They basically use neat blood pluming (talking about this may be a future fact) to keep the heat that is generated inside!  Swordfish have muscles behind their eyes that rapidly contract generating heat to help the eye and brain function. 
There's one fish that takes this to the extreme, the Opah! The Opah has similar plumbing to the Tuna, but they also have fatty tissue surrounding their organs and gills, like mammals, to allow them to retain heat!

Because humans, dogs, cats, sheep, horses, elephants, lizards, frogs, salamanders, and snakes are all animals with a backbone, technically they'd be fish. So, chances are, your fursona is a fish. 
But, I knows a fish when I sees one. So people have tried to define what exactly it is that we call fish! Soooo... Here's my working definition: A cold-blooded, aquatic animal with a backbone with appendages developed as fins whose chief respiratory organ is gills and whose body is usually covered in scales. If you know anything about fish, you probably are already thinking of exceptions to this definition! I ask that you let them be that, exceptions rather than falsifications.
